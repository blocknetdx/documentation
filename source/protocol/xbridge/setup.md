# XBridge Setup Guide
This guide explains how to setup and configure your client to use XBridge. If you have not yet setup the Blocknet wallet, start with the [Wallet Setup Guide](/wallet/setup).

XBridge is a decentralized exchange protocol with the ability to perform non-custodial, trustless, and decentralized exchange between any digital assets that is supported by the Blocknet Protocol. XBridge allows any application to perform decentralized exchange, opening the door to an ecosystem of decentralized trading services.

For each market you would like to trade on, you must run the full nodes of those blockchains in addition to the Blocknet wallet. For example, if you are trading on the BTC-LTC market, you must have the Blocknet, Litecoin, and Bitcoin wallets fully synced and running locally.

!!! info "Note: Full nodes are required."
	Lite wallets and Electrum wallets are not supported. You must run full blockchain nodes with `txindex=1`. In order to check if you are running a full node, use the `getblockchaininfo` command. You should see `"pruned": false,` if you are running a full node. If you see `"pruned": true,` then make sure `txindex=1` is in that wallet's configureation file and restart the wallet. See the [list of compatible blockchains](/protocol/xbridge/compatibility).

  A third party is working on implementing a lite multiwallet solution based off XRouter, but this has not been released yet.

To setup XBridge, follow these steps:

1. [Configure Wallet Confs](#configure-wallet-confs)
1. [Configure XBridge Conf](#configure-xbridge-conf)
1. [Next Steps](#next-steps)

---

To configure XBridge, Blocknet's `xbridge.conf` file and the wallet configuration files for each supported blockchain must be setup properly. Configuration is specific to the blockchain and wallet version. Here is a list of [compatible blockchains and wallet versions](/protocol/xbridge/compatibility). All configuration files can be found in the [blockchain-configuration-files Github repo](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files).

Blocknet uses a manifest ([view manifest](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/manifest-latest.json)) to determine which configurations to use based off the blockchain and wallet version. The manifest uses a code-friendly format called JSON.

This manifest uses "version groups", which is a group of wallet versions for a blockchain that pertain to a specific set of configurations. A blockchain can have multiple version groups, each with different sets of wallet versions. Each version group is separated by {curly brackets} and contains similar sets of information. The information you will need to focus on is the following:

Key          | Example Data (Bitcoin)                    | Description
-------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------
blockchain   | Bitcoin                                   | The name of the blockchain.
ticker       | BTC                                       | The blockchain's ticker.
ver_name     | Bitcoin v0.16.x                           | Version group name.
versions     | ["v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.16.3"] | The wallet versions compatible with this version group.
xbridge_conf | bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf                     | Filename of XBridge configs for these wallet version.
wallet_conf  | bitcoin--v0.16.0.conf                     | Filename of wallet config for these wallet versions.


## Configure Wallet Confs
1. In the [manifest](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/manifest-latest.json), find the version group for the blockchain you want to trade. For example, if you want to trade Bitcoin and have wallet version 0.17.0.1 then find the version group that says `"blockchain": "Bitcoin"` and has `"v0.17.0.1"` listed under `"versions"`. There are multiple version groups for Bitcoin, but only 1 version group with v0.17.0.1 listed under it:
```
  {
    "blockchain": "Bitcoin",
    "ticker": "BTC",
    "ver_id": "bitcoin--v0.17.0",
    "ver_name": "Bitcoin v0.17.x",
    "conf_name": "bitcoin.conf",
    "dir_name_linux": "bitcoin",
    "dir_name_mac": "Bitcoin",
    "dir_name_win": "Bitcoin",
    "repo_url": "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin",
    "versions": [
      "v0.17.0",
      "v0.17.0.1",
      "v0.17.1"
    ],
    "xbridge_conf": "bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf",
    "wallet_conf": "bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf"
  },
```
1. Take a note of the `"wallet_conf"` filename. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1 it is `bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf`.
1. Navigate to the `wallet-confs/` folder of the blockchain configuration files repo: [https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/tree/master/wallet-confs](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/tree/master/wallet-confs)
1. Open the file with the filename listed in the version group. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1, filename `bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf`, that would be this file: [https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/wallet-confs/bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/wallet-confs/bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf)
1. Copy that file's contents. These are the contents of `bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf`:
```
server=1
listen=1
rpcuser=
rpcpassword=
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
port=8333
rpcport=8332
txindex=1

# Legacy addresses must be used (address must begin with "1", not "3")
addresstype=legacy
changetype=legacy

# Enable deprecated calls
deprecatedrpc=signrawtransaction
```
1. Open the wallet's configuration file. For Bitcoin this is `bitcoin.conf`.
1. Delete any contents in this file. This is important because and duplicate settings can mess with the configuration.
1. Paste the previously copied file contents into the wallet's configuration file. 
1. Enter a username and password for `rpcuser=` and `rpcpassword=`. These should be difficult and secure credentials.
1. Enter the IP of your Blocknet client for `rpcallowip=`. If this blockchain will be hosted on the same computer as the Blocknet client, use `rpcallowip=127.0.0.1` (localhost).
1. Save the configuration file.
1. If the blockchain's wallet has been open, you will ned to restart it to load the updated configurations.
1. Repeat this process for each blockchain you want to trade.
1. There's an additional `dxnowallets=` setting unique to the `blocknet.conf`. If set to `1`, you will aggregate orders for all markets, not just for your connected assets. This is useful for view-only and browsing purposes. You will still need the wallets connected for any market you want to trade on. If a `dxnowallets=` setting is specified, it will override the `ShowAllOrders=` setting in your `xbridge.conf` header. 


#### XBridge Conf
1. In the [manifest](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/manifest-latest.json), find the version group for the blockchain you want to trade. For example, if you want to trade Bitcoin and have wallet version 0.17.0.1 then find the version group that says `"blockchain": "Bitcoin"` and has `"v0.17.0.1"` listed under `"versions"`. Thre are multiple version groups for Bitcoin, but only 1 version group with v0.17.0.1 listed under it:
```
  {
    "blockchain": "Bitcoin",
    "ticker": "BTC",
    "ver_id": "bitcoin--v0.17.0",
    "ver_name": "Bitcoin v0.17.x",
    "conf_name": "bitcoin.conf",
    "dir_name_linux": "bitcoin",
    "dir_name_mac": "Bitcoin",
    "dir_name_win": "Bitcoin",
    "repo_url": "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin",
    "versions": [
      "v0.17.0",
      "v0.17.0.1",
      "v0.17.1"
    ],
    "xbridge_conf": "bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf",
    "wallet_conf": "bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf"
  },
```
1. Take a note of the `"xbridge_conf"` filename. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1 it is `bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf`.
1. Navigate to the `xbridge-confs/` folder of the blockchain configuration files repo: [https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/tree/master/xbridge-confs](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/tree/master/xbridge-confs)
1. Open the file with the filename listed in the version group. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1, filename `bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf`, that would be this file: [https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/xbridge-confs/bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/xbridge-confs/bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf)
1. Copy that file's contents. These are the contents of `bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf`:
```
[BTC]
Title=Bitcoin
Address=
Ip=127.0.0.1
Port=8332
Username=
Password=
AddressPrefix=0
ScriptPrefix=5
SecretPrefix=128
COIN=100000000
MinimumAmount=0
TxVersion=2
DustAmount=0
CreateTxMethod=BTC
MinTxFee=7500
BlockTime=600
GetNewKeySupported=false
ImportWithNoScanSupported=false
FeePerByte=120
Confirmations=1
```
1. Open the `xbridge.conf` file. This file can be found in the Blocknet wallet data directory. This file is used to tell the Blocknet wallet how to communicate with the other wallets.
1. At the beginning of the file, enter the following main settings:
```
[Main]
ShowAllOrders=
ExchangeWallets=
FullLog=true
```
1. After the [Main] settings, paste the previously copied file contents.
1. Repeat this process and paste in the XBridge configurations for other blockchains.
1. Update each blockchain's `Username=`, `Password=`, and `Ip=` setting with the `rpcuser=`, `rpcpassword=`, and `rpcallowip=` values from the respective wallet conf file. The `Address=` setting can be left blank.
1. Update `Confirmations=` to how many confirmations you would for the asset the counterparty is trading. There are many security protections and precautions already in place, but this is recommended to be set to at least `1` for congested networks and networks with highly fluctuating fees to make sure transactions aren't kicked out of the mempool. This is already set to `Confirmations=1` by default for any networks that are deemed to meet this criteria.
1. The `ShowAllOrders=` is optional. If set to `true`, you will aggregate orders for all markets, not just for your connected assets. This is useful for view-only and browsing purposes. You will still need the wallets connected for any market you want to trade on. If a `dxnowallets=` setting is specified in your `blocknet.conf` file it will override this `ShowAllOrders=` setting. 
1. In the `ExchangeWallets=` entry in `xbridge.conf` add the all blockchains you want to trade, denoted by the chain's asset's ticker. Separate each ticker with a comma (no space).
    * Example: `ExchangeWallets=BLOCK,LTC,BTC,SYS`
1. Save the `xbridge.conf` file.
1. If the blockchain's wallet has been open, you will need to restart it to load the updated configurations.
	* Alternatively, the [dxLoadXBridgeConf](https://api.blocknet.co/#dxloadxbridgeconf) command can be used from either the Debug Console or the command line.

Example `xbridge.conf`:
```
[Main]
ShowAllOrders=true
ExchangeWallets=BLOCK,LTC,SYS
FullLog=true
