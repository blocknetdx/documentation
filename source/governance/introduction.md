title: Blocknet Superblock Governance
description: Blocknet is a self-funded and community-governed project through a 2-part governing system consisting of Service Nodes and Superblocks.


# Introduction
[Blocknet](/project/introduction) is a self-funded and community-governed project. Decentralization defines the template for group decision-making and is self-managed through a 2-part governing system consisting of Service Nodes and Superblocks. There is also additional funding aside from the Superblock, which is explained under [Community Funds](#community-funds).

## Superblock
Superblocks are special blocks that occur every 43,200 blocks, or approximately once each month. On each Superblock, **up to a maximum of 40,000 [BLOCK](/blockchain/introduction)** can be minted to fund the project. It's important to note that only the total amount of BLOCK requested by *passing* proposals will be minted, so **if no proposals pass then no BLOCK will be minted in the Superblock**. 

To request funding from a Superblock, a proposal must be submitted to the network prior to the Superblock. Service Node operators then have the opportunity to review these proposals and [vote on each proposal](/governance/proposal-voting) with either a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to approve or decline funding. 

---

#### Passing Criteria
For a proposal to pass and receive funding:

* 25% of all Service Nodes voting in this Superblock must have voted on the proposal
* 60% of votes must be "yes" (in favor)
* At this point all valid proposals are prioritized according to these requirements:
    1. Descending order by the sum of yes votes minus no votes
    1. Descending order by amount of yes votes
    1. Sequential order by block height the proposal is submitted (earlier blocks are first)
* The Superblock is then filled by as many valid proposals as possible according to the priority defined by (a), (b), and (c)
* If there are not enough funds remaining in the Superblock for a proposal to fit, it is skipped (not paid out), and the next proposal in the priority list is checked for qualification

## Community Funds
In addition to Superblocks, there are also Community Funds. These funds were created after a [staking protocol exploit](https://steemit.com/blocknet/@theblocknet/stake-bug-resolved-announcing-the-blocknet-bug-bounty) was successfully stopped and [it was voted on](http://blocknetdx.forumotion.com/t10-community-fund-proposals-redeem-fund-allocations) by the community to create various funds. [An additional proposal](/proposals/project-funding) was voted on (and passed) to also add the retrieved exploited funds to the Community Funds instead of those funds being burns, as was originally planned. 
<!--
The current balance and use of these funds can be tracked in the [Blocknet's Financial Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xFm5LJsRNN62-9XZFqfDckUt2x8ps3pUOBISUxNQYpc/). Usage of these funds go through a 3-of-5 approval process by the fund approvers.
