### Acquiring Initial BLOCK
When *making* a new order (i.e. creating a new offer to buy/sell some asset), there is no *Exchange Fee* on BlockDX. Therefore, it is possible to acquire BLOCK on the BlockDX exchange, even if you don't currently own any BLOCK. You simply make an offer to buy BLOCK on one of the more liquid trading pairs, like BLOCK/LTC, and wait for someone to *take* your order (i.e. wait for someone to accept your offer). However, if for some reason you can't wait for someone to accept your *maker* order to buy BLOCK, there are ways to acquire the small amount of BLOCK you need to pay the [Taker Fee](/blockdx/fees/#taker-fee):

1. [Join Blocknet's Discord](https://discord.gg/vGa7GeCu8B) and ask in the *#support* or *#trading* channel if someone would be kind enough to *tip* you a small amount of BLOCK to get you started trading on BlockDX. Chances are you'll find a generous person who will be happy to send you a *tip* via the *Discord Tip Bot*. After receiving a *tip* you can withdraw your BLOCK from the Discord Server by going to the *#tip-bot* channel in Blocknet Discord and entering:
```!withdraw address amount coin```
where ```address``` is your BLOCK address,
```amount``` is the amount of BLOCK to withdraw,
and ```coin``` is BLOCK.
1. Another option for acquiring a small amount of initial BLOCK is to [use the faucet](https://block.ccore.online/faucet).
