# Block DX Fee Structure
[Block DX](/blockdx/introduction) is a decentralized exchange dApp powered by the Blocknet Protocol. Unlike centralized exchanges, Block DX has no deposit, withdrawal, or maker fees other than network fees of the asset being traded.

---

## Maker Fee
When creating an order on Block DX, there is no fee other than the transaction fee for the network of the asset being sold. This is the same type of fee you would incur if sending this asset to another party.

Having no fee to place an order encourages market makers to add liquidity. This also makes it possible for a user to acquire the [BLOCK](/blockchain/introduction) needed to take orders.

---

## Taker Fee
When accepting an order on Block DX, a static fee of 0.015 [BLOCK](/blockchain/introduction) is charged at the time the order is taken. This fee is charged even if a trade is canceled or fails and is meant to discourage malicious behavior on the network. 

In addition to the 0.015 BLOCK fee, there is also the transaction fee for the network of the asset being sold. This is the same type of fee you would incur if sending this asset to another party.

If the taker asset is BLOCK, there needs to be *at least* two [UTXOs](/resources/glossary/#utxo) - one or more to cover the 0.015 BLOCK fee and one or more to cover the traded amount. 

In a future update, there will be a percent-based fee thatâ€™s charged when accepting an order, but the details of this are not yet finalized.

??? warning "Note: Taker Fee *must* be paid from the Blocknet core/native wallet; it cannot be paid with BLOCK stored in XLite. Having no BLOCK in your Blocknet core wallet will result in *Insufficient Funds* error from BlockDX when taking/accepting orders."
	For this reason, it's a good idea to keep a few BLOCK in your
	[Blocknet core/native wallet](/wallet/setup). In a soon-to-be-released version
	of BlockDX, it will be possible to pay the Taker Fee with BLOCK
	stored in XLite and it won't even be necessary to run Blocknet
	core wallet to trade on BlockDX.
