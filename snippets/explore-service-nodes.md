??? info "Explore Blocknet Network to see how many Service Nodes currently support each digital asset, and much, much more..."
	Before an asset can be traded on BlockDX, it must be supported by one or more [Service Nodes](/service-nodes/introduction). Blocknet community members have created several web based services to make it easy to discover which assets are currently supported by Service Nodes. Some of these websites actually offer much more information about the Blocknet Network than just how many Service Nodes support each digital asset:

	- To list all coins currently supported by Service Nodes for trading on BlockDX, open *Tools->Debug Console* in your Blocknet wallet and enter: `dxGetNetworkTokens`.  If using the CLI Blocknet wallet, issue the command, `./blocknet-cli dxGetNetworkTokens` from the directory where `blocknet-cli` is kept.
