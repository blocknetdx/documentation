## Verifying Downloads

It is important to verify the integrity of downloads before running them. Depending on how you downloaded it, it's possible the file may have been modified in transit to do something evil when run. The server hosting the download may also have been compromised.

1. Get the sha256 hash of the release you download. These are provided
on the Github release page as
[plain text in the release notes](https://github.com/blocknetdx/block-dx/releases/). The
format follows `SHA256-hash <filename>`. Here is an example of the hashes:
```

		1. Open the command prompt.
		1. Navigate to the location of the downloaded file.
		1. Enter `certUtil -hashfile filename SHA256` with `filename` replaced by the name fo the file you downloaded. 
		
		**Example**: `certUtil -hashfile BLOCK-DX-1.9.0-win.exe SHA256`

	??? example "MacOS"
		1. Open the terminal.
		1. Navigate to the location of the downloaded file.
		1. Enter `shasum -a 256 filename` with `filename` replaced by the name fo the file you downloaded.

	??? example "Linux"
		1. Open the terminal.
		1. Navigate to the location of the downloaded file.
