---

## A

---

#### Address
Each wallet has an *address* (or multiple). Addresses are used similar
to bank account routing and checking numbers to tell the network where
to send and receive funds during transactions. The address by default
is a 34 character alphanumeric string, but an *alias* can also be
created as a more user-friendly naming preference to refer to the
wallet's default address. Within each *address* there can exist
multiple [UTXOs](#utxo) , also called [Inputs](#input).



---

## B

---

#### BLOCK
*BLOCK* is the utility token for the Blocknet network. Unlike USD where the smallest denomination is $0.01, the smallest incremental unit of BLOCK is 0.00000001 BLOCK.

#### Blockchain Block
A *block* is a record of [transaction](#transaction) data in a set period of time ([block time](#block-time)). A time-series collection of the blocks makes up the [blockchain](#blockchain) (a chain of blocks).

#### Blockchain
A *blockchain* is a growing list of records, called [blocks](#blockchain-block), which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data.

#### Block DX
Block DX is a [decentralized exchange](#decentralized-exchange) dApp built with the [Blocknet Protocol](#blocknet-protocol) to showcase what can be built using it.

#### Blocknet
Blocknet is a self-funded and self-governed open source project with contributors around the world building an open and collaborative ecosystem with the development of the [Blocknet Protocol](#blocknet-protocol).

#### Blocknet Protocol
The Blocknet Protocol is a blockchain [interoperablity](#interoperability) protocol that consists of 3 components: [XBridge](#xbridge), [XRouter](#xrouter), and [XCloud](#xcloud).

#### Block Reward
A *block reward* is a reward you earn when [staking](#staking) for helping secure the network.

#### Block Time
*Block time* defines the time it takes to mine a [block](#blockchain-block). In all [blockchains](#blockchain) there is an expected block time. In [Blocknet](#blocknet), the expected block time is 1 minute.



---

## C

---

#### Change Address
A *change address* is the address where the remaining funds from an
[input](#input) are returned after making a
transaction. This is always an [address](#address) you own. If you
have an input that's 20 BLOCK used in a transaction sending 15 BLOCK,
then the remaining 5 BLOCK will be returned to the change
address. This is a similar concept to paying for a $15 item with a $20
bill and receiving a $5 bill back as change. Think of
[inputs](#input)/[UTXOs](#utxo) as bills.

#### Client
Depending on the context, *client* refers either to hardware running the Blocknet blockchain or software utilizing the Blocknet Protocol, which can be a blockchain, microservice, dApp, mobile app, website, etc.

#### Coin
*Coin* and *token* refers to [digital assets](#digital-asset).

#### Coin Control
*Coin Control* enables the ability to break up or combine [inputs](#input). This is comparable to going to a bank and exchanging a bunch of smaller bills for a $50 bill or breaking a larger bills for smaller denominations. Using Coin Control you can also choose to select specific inputs, addresses, and [change addresses](#change-address) to use for transactions.

#### Confirmation
When transactions are made, the transactions must go through a *confirmation* process, which validates the transaction to make sure it is authentic. Funds that are being confirmed cannot be used until 60 confirmations (about 60 minutes). 



---

## D

---

#### Decentralized Exchange
*Decentralized exchange* is the process exchanging [funds](#funds) between 2 parties with no middlemen. This requires the four core functions of an exchange to be decentralized: storage of funds, order books, order matching, and settlement.

#### DEX
*DEX* is a short-hand acronym for a [decentralized exchange](#decentralized-exchange).

#### Digital Asset
A *digital asset* is new asset class that describes digital cryptographic coins and tokens. These coins and tokens can represent monetary characteristics (cryptocurrency), digital or virtual goods (unique tokenized items, such as music or art), and ownership (tokenized shares, such as of land or a company). 



---

## E

---

#### Encrypted
*Encrypting* your wallet adds an additional level of security. An encrypted wallet requires a passphrase set by the user to spend funds the wallet.



---

## F

---

#### Funds
*Funds* refers to your [digital assets](#digital-asset).



<!-- ---

## G

---

## I

---

#### Input
Within a users [wallet](#wallet), the total balance is composed of either one large *input* or various smaller *inputs*. Think of inputs as bills in a wallet. You can have $100 in your wallet, but that may be composed of a single $100 bill, 5 $20 bills, etc. An input is sometimes also referred to as a [UTXO](#utxo).

#### Interchain Communication
*Interchain communication* is the ability for different blockchains to interact and communicate with each other. For example, one blockchain can write their latest block hashes to the Bitcoin blockchain and also call the data to add extra verification and security.

#### Interoperability
Blockchain *interoperability* is the ability for different blockchains to operate, interact, and communicate with one another. Interoperability comes in two parts: [exchange](#decentralized-exchange) and [communication](#interchain-communication).

---

## L

---

#### Locked
By having the wallet *locked*, funds cannot be sent and staking cannot be enabled. *Unlocking* the wallet, by entering in the passphrase(created when [encrypting](#encrypted) the wallet), is required to send funds and also allows [staking](#staking) to be enabled. The wallet can also be partially unlocked, which allows just for staking to be enabled, but does not allow the user to send funds.

#### Lite Wallet
A *lite wallet* is a wallet that does not require the full [blockchain](#blockchain) in order to function. It instead uses an external data source to provide [SPV](#spv) functionality.



---

## M

---

#### Mint
*Minting* is the process of generating new [digital assets](#digital-asset) on a blockchain that did not exist in any previous [blocks](#blockchain-block).

#### Multiwallet
A *multiwallet* is a [wallet](#wallet) that can store multiple types of [digital assets](#digital-asset).



---

## N

---

#### Naked Node
A *naked node* is a [Service Node](#service-node) that does not run any [xwallets](#xwallets).

#### Network
*Network* refers to the collection of peers and data on the blockchain.

#### Non-custodial
*Non-custodial* means the user has 100% control of their [funds](#funds). A third party has no control over it and cannot gain control if they wanted to.



---

## O

---

#### Open Source
*Open source* is used to describe software for which the source code is made freely available for contribution, redistributed, and modification.



---

## P

---

#### Peers
*Peers* are other wallets that you are connected to that help confirm transactions and share updated [blocks](#blockchain-block) and data between. When the wallet is not in sync, the wallet is brought up-to-date by [syncing](#syncing) with information from peers.

#### Proof-of-Stake
*Proof-of-stake*, also known as PoS, is a type of algorithm by which a blockchain [network](#network) achieves distributed consensus. 

#### Proposals
*Proposal* are suggested plans for consideration. Each [Superblock](#superblock) period, new proposals are submitted and [Service Nodes](#service-node) vote on these proposals. Proposals can also be used to request funding for contributions to the Blocknet ecosystem.

---

## R

---

#### Reward
A *reward* refers to a payment earned for providing a service.



---

## S

---

#### Service Node
*Service Nodes* provide services to the Blocknet [network](#network). They are users that own 5000 [BLOCK](#block) and have a certain setup outside of the wallet that allows them the ability to earn rewards for these service and grants them the ability to vote on [proposals](#proposals).

#### Snode
*Snode* is a short-hand term to refer to a [Service Node](#service-node).

#### SPV
*SPV* is an acronym that stands for Simplified Payment Verification. It is a method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block.

#### Staking
*Staking* is used to secure the network by confirming [blocks](#blockchain-block). Users that stake earn rewards. The reward can be referred to as a *stake*. When users earn a staking reward, it is tied to a specific [input](#input) in the user's wallet. For a user to stake, the option must be enabled.

#### Superblock
A *Superblock* refers to a specific [block](#blockchain-block) that occurs roughly once a month. The Superblock block finalizes the votes on any active [proposals](#proposals) and makes funding payouts for any passing proposals.

#### Syncing
In order to make [transactions](#transaction) or [stake](#staking), the [wallet](#wallet) needs to be up-to-date with the latest [blockchain](#blockchain) data. When a wallet is *Out of Sync*, it is not up-to-date. Alternatively, the wallet being synced means it is up-to-date.



---

## T

---

#### Token
*Token* and *coin* refers to [digital assets](#digital-asset).

#### Transaction
A transaction, similar to a bank transaction, is the process of transferring [funds](#funds) from one account to another..



---

## U

---

#### Unocked
By having the wallet *locked*, funds cannot be sent and staking cannot be enabled. *Unlocking* the wallet, by entering in the passphrase(created when [encrypting](#encrypted) the wallet), is required to send funds and also allows [staking](#staking) to be enabled. The wallet can also be partially unlocked, which allows just for staking to be enabled, but does not allow the user to send funds.

#### User
Refers to someone whom has a the wallet program installed on their computer. This may sometimes also be referred to as a [peer](#peers).

#### UTXO
UTXO stands for [Unspent Transaction Output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output). Within a user's [wallet](#wallet), the total balance is composed of either one large UTXO or various smaller UTXOs. Think of UTXOs as bills in a wallet. You can have $100 in your wallet, but that may be composed of a single $100 bill, 5 $20 bills, etc. A UTXO is sometimes also referred to as an [input](#input).


---

## V

---

#### Voting
Voting is performed by [Service Nodes](#service-node) to voice approval/disapproval of [proposals](#proposals).



---

## W

---

#### Wallet
A wallet is used to hold you [funds](#funds) of
[digital assets](#digital-asset). This is the digital version of your
physical wallet that holds physical money, very much like how your
bank account works. Every wallet has one or more associated
[Addresses](#address) and each wallet *address* can contain multiple
[UTXOs](#utxo), , also called [Inputs](#input).



---

## X
