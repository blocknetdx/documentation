title: Blocknet Wallet Lock/Unlock Guide
description: This guide explains how to lock, partially unlock, or fully unlock the Blocknet wallet, which is important to know for keeping your funds secure.


# Lock/Unlock Wallet
Controlling when the wallet is locked, fully unlocked, or unlocked just for staking is important for increasing the security of your funds. You must first encrypt the wallet to be able to lock it.

- **Locked** - When the wallet is locked, you are unable to spend funds or to stake. However, you can still navigate around it, see your balance and transaction history, receive funds, create an address, and edit address labels. If somebody were to gain access to your computer, they would not be able to access your funds without your passphrase to unlock it.
- **Unlocked** - When the wallet is unlocked, all functionality of the wallet is available, including spending your funds and staking. It is recommended to only have your wallet fully unlocked when you are spending funds and making transactions. If somebody were to gain access to your computer, they could easily access and steal your funds.
- **Unlocked for staking only** - When the wallet is unlocked for staking, it has the security of the wallet being locked, but has the benefit of allowing your funds to stake.

The passphrase used to encrypt the wallet is required to fully unlock the wallet or just unlock for staking.
