## Centralized Exchanges
Centralized exchanges are one of the most popular ways to trade
cryptocurrency. Some serve different markets, some are in direct
competition, some have cheaper fees, and some are subject to more or
less strict regulatory requirements. They are operated by a single
company, which may be obliged by the laws of the jurisdiction in which
it operates to collect data on its customers. The following options are available:
