<!-- 
======= Start: Related Links Section =======
- This is the related links section at the bottom of each page.
- It lists the links in the relatedLinks array variable below.
	Example: relatedLinks = [{"name":"Blocknet Website","link":"https://blocknet.co"},{"name":"API Docs","link":"https://api.blocknet.co"}];
- If the array is empty, ie. relatedLinks = [], then the related links section will not be displayed.
related-links.html
- The template and logic for the related links section can be found in docs/snippets/related-links.html
- The base path is defaulted to docs/snippets/, which can be edited in the mkdocs.yml file
- The template and logic is linked with markdown_extensions: pymdownx.snippets
