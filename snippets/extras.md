<!-- 
======= Related Links Section =======
- This is the related links section at the bottom of each page.
- It lists the links in the relatedLinks array variable below.
	Example: relatedLinks = [{"name":"Blocknet Website","link":"https://blocknet.co"},{"name":"API Docs","link":"https://api.blocknet.org"}];
- If the array is empty, ie. relatedLinks = [], then the related links section will not be displayed.
related-links.html
