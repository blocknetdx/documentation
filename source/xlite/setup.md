title: XLite Wallet Setup Guide
description: This guide explains how to setup your XLite wallet to securely store a variety of digital assets.

# Getting Started
The XLite wallet allows you to securely manage a variety of
[digital assets](/resources/glossary/#digital-asset) in a single, noncustodial, lightweight, decentralized wallet.

*  __*Noncustodial*__
means you own the private keys of all your assets. You don't have to
trust some third-party custodian with the private keys to your assets.
*  __*Lightweight*__
means you don't have to download the blockchains of the
assets you hold in XLite, many of which are hundreds of GB in
size. Some blockchains are many TB in size.
*  __*Decentralized*__ means access to your assets is supported
and guarnanteed by a decentralized network of independent nodes, not by any
single entity whose failure could prevent you from accessing your assets.

??? tip "When __*not*__ to use XLite"
	If XLite doesn't support the assets you want to trade on BlockDX, or if you
	simply prefer not to use XLite for trading some assets on BlockDX, then you'll need to
	install the native wallets of those assets to trade them on BlockDX. These native wallets are
	the native Qt/cli wallets released by each asset's respective project.
