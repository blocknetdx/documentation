# Proposal Submission
This guide explains how to create and submit Blocknet Superblock proposals for funded initiatives to be voted on by the Service Node network. Proposal submission is important for the decentralized governance model to function properly.

???+ info "Proposal Submission Deadline"
    The deadline for creating proposals is 2880 blocks prior to the Superblock.

## Create A Proposal

1. Submit a Draft Proposal to the [Blocknet Proposal Forum](https://forum.blocknet.co/c/draft-proposals).

	!!! tip "Tip: Before creating a new proposal, it's recommended to review previous proposals in the [Proposal Forum](https://forum.blocknet.co/c/draft-proposals) to get an idea of what is generally expected and acceptable."
	1. At the [Blocknet Proposal Forum](https://forum.blocknet.co/c/draft-proposals), you'll see this at the top of the page:
	![Draft Proposal](/img/governance/draft-proposal.png)
	1. Select *Draft Proposal* at the top left, then click *+ New Topic* at the top right of the screen.
	1. Create a proposal, embedding [Markdown Text](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html) as desired for formatting, which clearly and accurately conveys the following relevant information:
		1. Proposal name using only alpha-numerics (*example*: Qt-Exchange-Widget). Note, it's often useful to include the applicable SuperBlock number in the name, especially if you submit similar proposals each SuperBlock.
		1. Previous work relevant to this proposal
		1. What is being proposed
		1. Rationale and further explanation of proposal & background info
		1. Technical explanation/agenda of feature/proposal
		1. Estimated time for components in the proposal
		1. Teams/person undertaking and responsible for the work
		1. Cost assessment
		1. Fund custodians

1. Once the Draft Proposal has been submitted and posted to the forum, copy the post's URL and create a shortened URL at [https://bit.ly/](https://bit.ly/)
1. Continue on to [submit the proposal from the Qt wallet](/governance/create-proposal/#submit-from-the-qt-wallet) or to [submit the proposal via command line](/governance/create-proposal/#submit-from-the-terminal).
1. (Optional) Once the proposal has been submitted, your proposal will be assigned a `voting hash` (a large string of numbers and letter representing your proposal). The `voting hash` for your proposal will be displayed in a Pop-Up window after submitting your proposal in the Qt/GUI wallet. If using the Command Line Interface, the `voting hash` will be returned after submitting the proposal via the `createproposal` command. You can also display `voting hash` and other information about all upcoming proposals as follows:
	1. In Blocknet Qt/GUI wallet, go to *Tools->Debug Console*
	1. Type `listproposals <last_SB_number + 1>` where `<last_SB_number + 1>` is 1 more than the [number of the previous SuperBlock](/governance/introduction/#superblock-dates).

	Once you have your proposal's `voting hash`, you can now edit your post in the Proposal Forum to add the command for voting for your proposal from the command line: `vote [hash] yes`.

## Submit from the Qt Wallet

??? example "Submit using the redesigned wallet"
	![Redesigned Wallet](/img/wallet-redesign/wallet-redesign.png)

	1. Open and sync the [Blocknet wallet](/wallet/setup). The wallet needs to be unlocked to submit a proposal.
	1. Ensure there is a minimum of 11 BLOCK in your wallet to pay for the proposal submission fee (10 BLOCK fee + transaction fee). This fee should be added to the proposal amount (in a later step) so that you are reimbursed if the proposal passes (see [passing criteria](/governance/introduction/#passing-criteria)). If you would like to confirm the submission fee you can use the `proposalfee` command.
	1. In the side menu, go to *Proposals*.
	1. Click on the *Create New Proposal* button at the top of the screen.
	1. Fill out the form fields:

		* *Proposal name* = The name of the proposal using only alpha-numerics.
		* *URL* = The shortened URL for the proposal link created.
		* *Description* = A short description of the proposal.
		* *Superblock #* = The Superblock block number the proposal is being submitted for.
		* *Amount* = The amount of funding requested (must be a whole number).
		* *Payment address* = The BLOCK address the funding will be paid out to.
		* A total of 107 characters can be used for the proposal name, URL, and description combined.

	1. Click the *Continue* button at the bottom of the screen.
	1. Follow the screens to review the information and submit the proposal.
	1. Wait for the transaction to have 1 confirmation (about 1 minute) then verify the proposal has been properly submitted by [viewing the proposals](/governance/view-proposals).


??? example "Submit using the classic wallet"
	![Classic Wallet](/img/wallet-classic/wallet-classic.png)

	1. Open and sync the [Blocknet wallet](/wallet/setup). The wallet needs to be unlocked to submit a proposal.
	1. Ensure there is a minimum of 11 BLOCK in your wallet to pay for the proposal submission fee (10 BLOCK fee + transaction fee). This fee should be added to the proposal amount (in a later step) so that you are reimbursed if the proposal passes (see [passing criteria](/governance/introduction/#passing-criteria)). If you would like to confirm the submission fee you can use the `proposalfee` command.
	1. In the program menu, go to *Window* > *Console*. The debug console will open in a new window.
	1. The proposal submission command uses the following command structure (all one line): 

			createproposal [PROPOSAL_NAME] [SUPERBLOCK_BLOCK] [AMOUNT] [ADDRESS] [URL] [DESCRIPTION]

		* `PROPOSAL_NAME` = The name of the proposal using only alpha-numerics.
		* `SUPERBLOCK_BLOCK` = The Superblock block number the proposal is being submitted for.

			  * Specifying a value of `0` automatically submits for the next Superblock.
			  * If you know the Superblock block number you wish to create a proposal for, then enter that value instead of `0`.

		* `AMOUNT` = The amount of funding requested.
		* `ADDRESS` = The BLOCK address the funding will be paid out to.
		* `URL` = The shortened URL for the proposal link created.
		* `DESCRIPTION` = A short description of the proposal.
		* A total of 107 characters can be used for PROPOSAL_NAME, URL, and DESCRIPTION combined.

	1. Type the above command replacing the variables with the respective values in place. Below is an example:

			createproposal privacy-mixer 0 100 Bxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx https://goo.gl/xxxxxxx "Build privacy mixer app"

	1. Press the *Enter* key to submit the proposal to the network.
	1. Wait for the transaction to have 1 confirmation (about 1 minute) then verify the proposal has been properly submitted by [viewing the proposals](/governance/view-proposals).
