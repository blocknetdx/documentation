## Introduction

The Blocknet Protocol is supported by a network of Service Nodes, which are similar to masternodes but with an increased level of participation. These Service Nodes are used as a DHT network overlay to support [XBridge](/protocol/xbridge/introduction), XRouter, and XCloud services. In order to support these service, they host full nodes of the blockchains the protocol is compatible with, host microservices, verify interactions between peers, route communication between blockchains, and perform anti-spam and anti-DOS measures for the network. Service Nodes can also [vote](/governance/proposal-voting) to participate in Blocknet's [self-governance system](/governance/introduction).

Service Nodes require 5000 [BLOCK](/blockchain/introduction). If seeking to acquire BLOCK, [there are various options available](/project/exchanges).

<!-- 
Service Nodes operators are rewarded according to which type of Service Node they are acting as.

There are two types of Service Nodes:
‘Naked’ Service Nodes - Not supporting any digital assets on the  Blocknet protocol
‘Hosting’ Service Nodes - Supporting at least one digital asset on the Blocknet protocol

Rewards
Service Nodes operators are rewarded according to which type of Service Node they are acting as.


XWallets

Operating as a ‘Hosting’ Service Node requires running and maintaining full nodes of each digital asset.
