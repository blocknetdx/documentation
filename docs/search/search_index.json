Blocknet is an open sourced, self-funded, and self-governed project with contributors around the world building an open and collaborative ecosystem. Subscribe to the following email lists for the latest features, updates, and news! General Newsletter Service Node Newsletter Developer Newsletter Technical Overview \u00b6 Blocknet is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain with a utility token called BLOCK . Unlike other currency-focused blockchains, Blocknet is a service-based blockchain comprised of 3 main components: XRouter - Provides blockchain interoperability for the Blocknet Protocol with a communication layer consisting of a decentralized inter-blockchain SPV client backend that enables the verification of blockchain records without requiring users to download the full blockchain. XRouter allows applications to interface with blockchains on the TCP/IP networking layer, enabling a true Internet of Blockchains. By default, XRouter is compatible with all blockchains. XBridge - Provides the ability to perform trustless exchange between any digital assets that is supported by the Blocknet Protocol via APIs. XBridge allows any application to perform decentralized exchange, opening the door to an ecosystem of decentralized trading services. See the list of compatible assets . XCloud - Provides a decentralized oracle network powered by XRouter. XCloud allows applications to run entirely decentralized by enabling on-chain use of off-chain data, APIs, and services, opening the door to the possibility of monetizable, fully decentralized applications. The Blocknet Protocol is designed to maximize interoperability between different blockchains through the use of these components. Just as the internet connected computers, the Blocknet Protocol is critical for blockchains to communicate and realize full potential . Nodes \u00b6 The network is powered by 2 types of nodes: Staking Nodes - Secures the network by staking BLOCK to verify the blockchain. This service earns 100% of block rewards and the fees for transactions in that block. Service Nodes - Hosts the full nodes of compatible blockchains, serves oracle data, audits interactions, and performs anti-spam and anti-DOS measures for the network. This service earns 100% of fees generated from use of the network's services ( XBridge , XRouter , XCloud ). The following are the requirements to operate each type of node: Staking Nodes - A Staking Node can be operated with any amount of BLOCK, but staking more BLOCK yields more frequent rewards. Service Nodes - A Service Node requires 5000 BLOCK. Explore Blocknet Network to see how many Service Nodes currently support each digital asset, and much, much more... Before an asset can be traded on BlockDX, it must be supported by one or more Service Nodes . Blocknet community members have created several web based services to make it easy to discover which assets are currently supported by Service Nodes. Some of these websites actually offer much more information about the Blocknet Network than just how many Service Nodes support each digital asset: To list all coins currently supported by Service Nodes for trading on BlockDX, open Tools->Debug Console in your Blocknet wallet and enter: dxGetNetworkTokens . If using the CLI Blocknet wallet, issue the command, ./blocknet-cli dxGetNetworkTokens from the directory where blocknet-cli is kept. CloudChainsServiceExplorer (Thank you @lucien !)

Raw Volume Data Staking Rewards Calculator Tokenomics \u00b6 BLOCK is the utility token that powers the Blocknet. Fees are paid in BLOCK when using the network and 100% of those fees are distributed to Service Nodes for supporting the network and infrastructure. Normal transaction fees on the network are also paid in BLOCK and awarded to stakers. If seeking to acquire BLOCK, there are various options available . Blocknet involves multiple economic models with respect to the use of the BLOCK token. Block Rewards - Blocknet is Proof-of-Stake(PoS) with 1 BLOCK created every minute which is awarded to stakers. Stakers also receive the network transaction fees for the block they have validated. Read more about staking rewards . Service Fees - Service Nodes receive 100% of BLOCK fees generated from the use of services on the network, including trades performed via XBridge, interfacing with blockchains via XRouter, and use of microservices via XCloud. Collateral - BLOCK is required for collateral to operate a Service Node, as well as to use certain services on the network. Governance - Submitting proposals to the network requires a fee to be paid in BLOCK and proposals can only be voted on by Service Nodes. Transaction Fees - Transferring funds on the network incurs a transaction fee that's paid in BLOCK and awarded to stakers. The utility of the BLOCK token increases the buy pressure on the market, while the reward potential of operating a node reduces sell pressure on the market. // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

Swapping WAVAX=>aaBLOCK will work if you only hold AVAX in your MetaMask wallet because AVAX will automatically be wrapped into WAVAX as needed. However, when swapping aaBLOCK=>WAVAX, you may not see the WAVAX you acquire from the swap in your MetaMask wallet (unless you add WAVAX custom token to MetaMask). Instead, you may need to perform an additional step of swapping WAVAX=>AVAX (at a ratio of 1:1). After that, you'll see your AVAX appear in your MetaMask wallet.

Bridging Fees \u00b6 There is no fee for bridging BLOCK to aaBLOCK (a.k.a. wrapping BLOCK into aaBLOCK). However, when unwrapping aaBLOCK to redeem the BLOCK inside, there is a 0.1% \"gateway\" fee, payable in BLOCK. (min gateway fee = 5 BLOCK; min redeem amount = 10 BLOCK). Also, to cover gas fees, users should maintain a small amount of AVAX in their wallets.

Be aware, however, that it is the target of many scammers, some of whom have written very ingenious malware to steal your MetaMask private keys. The Internet is full of reports of funds being stolen from MetaMask wallets. If you use MetaMask, take prudent safety precautions: Run a good Anti-Virus program, such as Bitdefender, at all times. Configure it to give Web protection for Chrome browsing. Never leave MetaMask unlocked any longer than you must to complete your transactions. Never surf the web in Chrome with MetaMask unlocked, and never unlock MetaMask with tab(s) open to questionable sites. Even if a malicious site is open in a different tab, its malware can still access MetaMask. Only confirm transactions in MetaMask after carefully reading all the details of the transaction. Note, some malware can display fake transaction details on top of parts of the transaction. That's why you need to read all the details of the transaction before confirming it. What is aaBLOCK? \u00b6 aaBLOCK is a \"wrapped\" version of the BLOCK coin. It's the same BLOCK we know and love, but with a wrapper around it which allows it to exist on the Avalanche blockchain as an ARC20 token. Just as a man needs to wear a spacesuit to exist on the moon, so does BLOCK need to don a wrapper to exist on a non-native blockchain. By design, there is exactly one BLOCK coin wrapped inside each aaBLOCK token. In other words, there is a 1:1 mapping between BLOCK and aaBLOCK at the bridge where wrapping and unwrapping take place. This does not mean the price of aaBLOCK will always be exactly the same as the price of BLOCK. Just as the price of BLOCK can be different from one exchange to another, so too can the price of aaBLOCK be different from one exchange to another. Likewise, the price of aaBLOCK on one exchange can be different from the price of BLOCK on another exchange. The only thing guaranteed about the price of aaBLOCK is that it will be exactly equal to the price of BLOCK at the wrapping/unwrapping bridge. This one guarantee, however, can create arbitrage opportunities for anyone who notices a discrepancy between the price of aaBLOCK on one exchange and the price of BLOCK on another exchange. For example, if aaBLOCK is selling for $150 / aaBLOCK on Pangolin, while BLOCK is simultaneously selling for only $125 / BLOCK on BlockDX, one can buy BLOCK on BlockDX, wrap it into aaBLOCK, then sell the aaBLOCK on Pangolin for a $25 / BLOCK profit! Why aaBLOCK? \u00b6 aaBLOCK has been created to improve accessibility to BLOCK As of this writing, BLOCK is not listed on many high liquidity exchanges. Our own BlockDX has also not yet acheived a high level of liquidity. Even if BlockDX had high liquidity, at present it still requires more setup than is convenient for some potential investors. Furthermore, the exchange on which BLOCK currently has the highest liquidity (Bittrex Global) is not even accessible to investors in the USA. The net result of all this is that those wanting to invest in BLOCK sometimes feel it is inconvenient to do so, or they feel it's difficult to invest in volume at a fair market price. aaBLOCK will make it possible for people from every country to buy BLOCK (as aaBLOCK) on Pangolin, an easily accessible, easy to use, very high liquidity, decentralized exchange. (Note, aaBLOCK may also be tradable on Anyswap and other exchanges in the future.) Having purchased aaBLOCK, investors will then have several options of what to do with it: They can HODL it and watch it increase in value over time. They can trade it on Pangolin for some other asset. They can earn steady income with it by adding liquidity to the aaBLOCK/AVAX liquidity pool on Pangolin. They can \"unwrap\" it. In other words, they can unbridge it back to native BLOCK at a ratio of 1:1. Native BLOCK can then be used for Blocknet network staking and/or Blocknet Service Node collateral . How aaBLOCK? \u00b6 BLOCK is wrapped into aaBLOCK, and aaBLOCK is unwrapped to redeem the BLOCK inside at https://v1.anyswap.exchange/bridge . Management of wrapping and unwrapping is powered by Fusion's Distributed Control Rights Management (DCRM) . DCRM uses a decentralized custodian model which locks BLOCK coins as it wraps them into aaBLOCK, and keeps them securely locked until an equal amount of aaBLOCK is burnt/unwrapped.

Unwrapping fees \u00b6 There is no fee for wrapping BLOCK into aBLOCK (a.k.a. bridging BLOCK to aBLOCK). However, when unwrapping aBLOCK to redeem the BLOCK inside (a.k.a. unbridging aBLOCK to BLOCK), there is a 0.1% \"gateway\" fee, payable in BLOCK. (min gateway fee = 5 BLOCK; min redeem amount = 10 BLOCK). Also, to cover gas fees, users should maintain some ETH in their wallets.

Be aware, however, that it is the target of many scammers, some of whom have written very ingenious malware to steal your MetaMask private keys. The Internet is full of reports of funds being stolen from MetaMask wallets. If you use MetaMask, take prudent safety precautions: Run a good Anti-Virus program, such as Bitdefender, at all times. Configure it to give Web protection for Chrome browsing. Never leave MetaMask unlocked any longer than you must to complete your transactions. Never surf the web in Chrome with MetaMask unlocked, and never unlock MetaMask with tab(s) open to questionable sites. Even if a malicious site is open in a different tab, its malware can still access MetaMask. Only confirm transactions in MetaMask after carefully reading all the details of the transaction. Note, some malware can display fake transaction details on top of parts of the transaction. That's why you need to read all the details of the transaction before confirming it. For Anyswap, there aren't any options other than MetaMask (and Ledger). However, for providing liquidity on Uniswap, you have these alternatives to MetaMask: Coinbase Wallet , Walletconnect , Fortmatic , Portis . What is aBLOCK? \u00b6 aBLOCK is a \"wrapped\" version of the BLOCK coin. It's the same BLOCK we know and love, but with a wrapper around it which allows it to exist on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token. Just as a man needs to wear a spacesuit to exist on the moon, so does BLOCK need to don a wrapper to exist on a non-native blockchain. By design, there is exactly one BLOCK coin wrapped inside each aBLOCK token. In other words, there is a 1:1 mapping between BLOCK and aBLOCK at the bridge where wrapping and unwrapping take place. This does not mean the price of aBLOCK will always be exactly the same as the price of BLOCK. Just as the price of BLOCK can be different from one exchange to another, so too can the price of aBLOCK be different from one exchange to another. Likewise, the price of aBLOCK on one exchange can be different from the price of BLOCK on another exchange. The only thing guaranteed about the price of aBLOCK is that it will be exactly equal to the price of BLOCK at the wrapping/unwrapping bridge. This one guarantee, however, can create arbitrage opportunities for anyone who notices a discrepancy between the price of aBLOCK on one exchange and the price of BLOCK on another exchange. For example, if aBLOCK is selling for $150 / aBLOCK on Anyswap, while BLOCK is simultaneously selling for only $125 / BLOCK on BlockDX, one can buy BLOCK on BlockDX, wrap it into aBLOCK, then sell the aBLOCK on Anyswap for a $25 / BLOCK profit! Why aBLOCK? \u00b6 aBLOCK has been created to meet a couple of immediate needs: 1. Liquidity & Accessibility. \u00b6 As of this writing, BLOCK is not listed on many high liquidity exchanges. Our own BlockDX has also not yet acheived a high level of liquidity. Even if BlockDX had high liquidity, at present it still requires more setup than is convenient for some potential investors. Furthermore, the exchange on which BLOCK currently has the highest liquidity (Bittrex Global) is not even accessible to investors in the USA. The net result of all this is that those wanting to invest in BLOCK sometimes feel it is inconvenient to do so, or they feel it's difficult to invest in volume at a fair market price. aBLOCK will make it possible for people from every country to buy BLOCK (as aBLOCK) on Uniswap, an easily accessible, easy to use, very high liquidity, decentralized exchange. (Note, aBLOCK will also be tradable on Anyswap and possibly other exchanges.) Having purchased aBLOCK, investors will then have several options of what to do with it: They can HODL it and watch it increase in value over time. They can trade it on Uniswap, Anyswap, etc. for some other asset. They can earn steady income with it by adding liquidity to some aBLOCK liquidity pool on Uniswap, Anyswap, etc. They can \"unwrap\" it. In other words, they can bridge it back to native BLOCK at a ratio of 1:1. Native BLOCK can then be used for Blocknet network staking and/or Blocknet Service Node collateral . 2. Payment vehicle for Hydra, Blocknet's Decentralized Infura Solution \u00b6 Another advantage of having aBLOCK is that it will serve as a convenient payment vehicle for Hydra, Blocknet's Decentralized Infura Solution. Since Hydra is a Blocknet service, it makes sense to charge for its use in Blocknet's own BLOCK coin. However, since many Hydra clients will not have a Blocknet wallet, it will be more convenient for them if we charge usage fees in a token which exists on the Ethereum chain, i.e an ERC20 token. aBLOCK satisfies both the desire to charge Hydra fees in our own BLOCK coin (wrapped as aBLOCK), and also the desire to accept fees in an ERC20 token which can be very easily obtained on Uniswap. How aBLOCK? \u00b6 BLOCK is wrapped into aBLOCK, and aBLOCK is unwrapped to redeem the BLOCK inside at https://v1.anyswap.exchange/bridge . Management of wrapping and unwrapping is powered by Fusion's Distributed Control Rights Management (DCRM) . DCRM uses a decentralized custodian model which locks BLOCK coins as it wraps them into aBLOCK, and keeps them securely locked until an equal amount of aBLOCK is burnt/unwrapped.

Since order broadcast and order matching are completely decentralized, there are no bottlenecks other than the ones which lie with users, namely their local internet connections. In addition though, there is a shared capacity in the broadcasting system, which is extremely high. Here is a relevant quotation from a Bitcoin wiki : Bitcoin Wiki Let's assume an average rate of 2000tps, so just VISA. Transactions vary in size from about 0.2 kilobytes to over 1 kilobyte, but it's averaging half a kilobyte today. That means that you need to keep up with around 8 megabits/second of transaction data (2000tps * 512 bytes) / 1024 bytes in a kilobyte / 1024 kilobytes in a megabyte = 0.97 megabytes per second * 8 = 7.8 megabits/second. This sort of bandwidth is already common for even residential connections today, and is certainly at the low end of what colocation providers would expect to provide you with. When blocks are solved, the current protocol will send the transactions again, even if a peer has already seen it at broadcast time. Fixing this to make blocks just list of hashes would resolve the issue and make the bandwidth needed for block broadcast negligible. So whilst this optimization isn't fully implemented today, we do not consider block transmission bandwidth here. BLOCK Inflation \u00b6 While there is no maximum limit due to the Blocknet blockchain being Proof of Stake, there is a limit to the amount that can be minted per period (limited inflation). This means that over time the inflation rate decreases as the circulation increases and the amount of BLOCK minted remains constant. Below are 2 sets of data that demonstrate this. Lower Bound of Inflation In this first set of data, the inflation rate displayed takes into account just block rewards . The below data represents the minimum inflation possible. View data Upper Bound of Inflation In this second set of data, the inflation rate displayed takes into account both block rewards and the maximum Superblocks amount . It's important to note that the Superblock does not need to mint the full 40,000 BLOCK so in reality the inflation will likely never reach these levels.

Tip for Goldcoin (GLC) traders Make sure you have installed the latest BlockDX (v1.9.0 or greater) Make sure you have installed the latest version of Goldcoin wallet (v0.14.7 or above) If you created your Goldcoin wallet using an earlier version of the Goldcoin wallet app, you may have a Goldcoin data directory named, GoldCoin (GLD) . You can check this by navigating in a File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) to this location: Windows: %appdata% Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/ Linux: ~/ If you see a directory here named, GoldCoin (GLD) , close your Goldcoin wallet and rename GoldCoin (GLD) to Goldcoin (note the small c in coin ). In the case of Linux, rename it to .goldcoin . Restart your Goldcoin wallet and verify it shows the correct balance. If the Goldcoin app asks you to specify the data directory, select the default directory, which should be the new Goldcoin data directory you just made by renaming the old data directory. Install Block DX . This is a desktop dApp and not supported in-browser. Warning You must have the Blocknet wallet and the wallets of the assets you will be trading and/or the XLite wallet installed before continuing. You must also have BlockDX v1.9.x or greater to use XLite with BlockDX. Read about when to use XLite vs when to use asset native wallets 2 Step Configuration \u00b6 Step 1 - This step is required for everyone. This step must be performed before Step 2 When you first open BlockDX, you should see the FRESH SETUP screen below. (If you don't see this screen, choose the Fresh Setup option when it's presented, or arrive at the Fresh Setup option through Menu->Add & Update Wallets .): It is recommended you use the Quick Setup option, but if you use custom data directories for your wallets then you'll need to use the Expert Setup option. It's recommended to configure all native coin wallets you have installed. Skip those assets you will trade from XLite, even if their native coin wallets are installed. Blocknet native wallet cannot be skipped, but you can still trade BLOCK from XLite if you wish. When you arrive at the CONFIGURATION COMPLETE screen, be sure to carefully read and follow steps 1 & 2 BEFORE clicking RESTART After configuration is complete, you can add new wallets or reconfigure existing wallets at any time under MENU->Add & Update Wallets . Step 2 - This step is required if some of the digital assets you'll be trading will be stored in XLite wallet . Firstly, if you haven't already done so, install XLite wallet , create a new XLite wallet for yourself, and backup your 12 word mnemonic phrase, then leave XLite open and unlocked. At this point, you should have Blocknet wallet open and unlocked, XLite open and unlocked, and BlockDX also open. In BlockDX, you will likely see an OPEN CONFIGURATION screen like this: On this screen, you should click OPEN CONFIGURATION If you didn't see the OPEN CONFIGURATION screen pictured above, click here. You will likely see a screen similar to this: On this screen, select MENU->Add & Update Wallets . You should now see a screen like the following and you should select Litewallet Setup . Note: Future versions of BlockDX may give an option at this point to specify a non-standard path for the Cloudchains, xlite and/or BLOCK-DX directories. The defaults for these three directories are: Windows: BLOCK-DX dir is found in %localappdata% ; xlite and Cloudchains dirs are found in %appdata% . MacOS: ~/Library/Application Support/ linux: ~/.config/ Clicking CONTINUE on the above screen will take you to the following screen: On this screen, uncheck all assets you don't want to trade from XLite. For example, any assets for which you configured the asset's native wallet in Step 1 above should be unchecked . One possible exception to this is the Blocknet native wallet. Even though the Blocknet native wallet was configured in Step 1 above, you should check the Blocknet box here if you want to trade BLOCK from XLite rather than trading it from the Blocknet native wallet. Tip: Keep a few BLOCK in your Blocknet native wallet to cover Taker Fees . Taker Fees are currently deducted from Blocknet native wallet. Therefore, to avoid Insufficient Funds errors, it's a good idea to keep a few BLOCK in your Blocknet native wallet.

For any questions not answered below, please join the Blocknet community on Discord for further discussion: Discord Invite Bug: If you used Generate New Address in BlockDX to generate the address to which the asset you just acquired should be sent, and the trade completed successfully but the asset didn't arrive in XLite as expected, click here for instructions what to do. Click on Receive in the upper right corner of XLite. Select the asset which did not arrive in XLite. Click Generate new address until the address to which the missing asset was sent appears in the Your address box. Why does my available balance in BlockDX drop dramatically when I make an order, even though the size of the order is small? Why does available balance in BlockDX drop so dramatically when making an order? \u00b6 Funds in your wallet are organized in terms of addresses and inputs . To illustrate, we can make an analogy to a physical wallet. An address is like a section of your physical wallet which is separated from other sections. An input is like a bill that is stored in one section of your wallet. In one section of your physical wallet you might have three $20 bills and two $5 bills, for a total of $70 in that section of your wallet. In a similar way, one address of your Blocknet wallet might contain three 20 BLOCK inputs and two 5 BLOCK inputs, for a total of 70 BLOCK in that address of your wallet. If, for example, you make an order to buy some asset, and the cost of your purchase will be 5 LTC, but the smallest LTC input in your wallet is 100 LTC, then the entire 100 LTC input becomes unavailable until the change from the transaction is received in your change address . This is like if you are buying a $5 item and the smallest bill in your wallet is a $100 bill. The $100 bill becomes unavailable during the transaction, then you receive $95 in change. To avoid having a large amount of funds becoming unavailable during a transaction in this way, you can split the inputs of the asset you're selling before making the order. This is like breaking your $100 bill into smaller denominations before purchasing the $5 item. Splitting assets into multiple Inputs within an address can be done using the dxSplitInputs command from the Blocknet wallet Tools->Debug Console , or from the Blocknet wallet Command Line Interface (CLI). Get help on how to use dxsplitinputs by typing dxsplitinputs in the Debug Console and hitting return, or by typing ./blocknet-cli help dxsplitinputs from the Blocknet wallet CLI. You may also want to use the dxSplitAddress command. Get help on how to use the dxsplitaddress command by typing dxsplitaddress in the Debug Console and hitting return, or by typing ./blocknet-cli help dxsplitaddress from the Blocknet wallet CLI. Note: Splitting assets into multiple inputs incurs a transaction fee, and the transaction fee for some chains (e.g. BTC Tx fee ) can be high. Soon, BlockDX will offer to automatically split assets into smaller inputs in the background so you'll always have some \"small change\" on hand, ready to trade. How can I view currently active orders on BlockDX without opening the BlockDX application? Visit the following site: BlockNetMonitor My version of [blockchain] wallet isn\u2019t one of the options to select in the set up process. Can I use this version? Will it still work? Only use wallet versions that are listed. If a version is not listed, it has either not been tested yet or is not compatible. Using a wallet version not listed may result in failed trades or loss of funds. I have Block DX currently working with two wallets. I want to add a third blockchain wallet. Do I need to restart all wallets and go through the set up process again? Yes, at this point in time the setup process needs to be repeated to add additional wallets. However, the blockchains previously selected will be remembered at the initial selection screen when repeating the setup process. The option to go through the setup process again can be found in the upper right corner of BlockDX under MENU->Add & Update Wallets. I am trading with BLOCK/LTC. If I make an order with BUY, does that mean I want to buy BLOCK (and sell LTC)? If I select \u201cSELL,\u201d that means I am selling BLOCK and will receive LTC? If in the BLOCK/LTC market and using BUY order form, you will be buying BLOCK with LTC. Using the SELL order form means you will be selling BLOCK to receive LTC. Do I always need to download and use full blockchains when trading? Block DX is a full decentralized exchange with no central components, which requires the full blockchains to be installed and synced locally to submit the trades as transactions on the network. However, if the assets you want to trade are supported by XLite wallet , you can use XLite and avoid downloading the full blockchains. Do I need to have BLOCK in order to trade? If you are making (placing) an order, no BLOCK is needed. If you are taking (filling) an order, BLOCK is need to cover the trade fee. Read more... If I want to place or accept multiple trades, I need to split my assets into multiple UTXOs within the same address. How do I do that? Splitting assets into multiple UTXOs within an address can be done using the dxSplitInputs command from the Blocknet wallet Tools->Debug Console , or from the Blocknet wallet Command Line Interface (CLI). Get help on how to use dxsplitinputs by typing dxsplitinputs in the Debug Console and hitting return, or by typing ./blocknet-cli help dxsplitinputs from the Blocknet wallet CLI. You may also want to use the dxSplitAddress command. Get help on how to use the dxsplitaddress command by typing dxsplitaddress in the Debug Console and hitting return, or by typing ./blocknet-cli help dxsplitaddress from the Blocknet wallet CLI. I keep getting change addresses after making trades. How do I consolidate them all back into one address and then split them back up into multiple UTXOs again? Combining and splitting of assets (inputs) can be done using the Coin Control functionality within the respective wallet. Why is my balance shown as 0 even though I have funds in it. Some blockchains have Segwit enabled, which uses a different address system. At the moment these new Segwit addresses are not supported so legacy addresses must be used. For example, with Litecoin \u2018L\u2019 addresses should be used instead of \u2018M\u2019 addresses and with Monacoin \u2018M\u2019 addresses should be used instead of \u2018P\u2019 addresses. Why is my balance on Block DX different than in my wallet?

To illustrate, we can make an analogy to a physical wallet. An address is like a section of your physical wallet which is separated from other sections. An input is like a bill that is stored in one section of your wallet. In one section of your physical wallet you might have three $20 bills and two $5 bills, for a total of $70 in that section of your wallet. In a similar way, one address of your Blocknet wallet might contain three 20 BLOCK inputs and two 5 BLOCK inputs, for a total of 70 BLOCK in that address of your wallet. If, for example, you make an order to buy some asset, and the cost of your purchase will be 5 LTC, but the smallest LTC input in your wallet is 100 LTC, then the entire 100 LTC input becomes unavailable until the change from the transaction is received in your change address . This is like if you are buying a $5 item and the smallest bill in your wallet is a $100 bill. The $100 bill becomes unavailable during the transaction, then you receive $95 in change. To avoid having a large amount of funds becoming unavailable during a transaction in this way, you can split the inputs of the asset you're selling before making the order. This is like breaking your $100 bill into smaller denominations before purchasing the $5 item. Splitting assets into multiple Inputs within an address can be done using the dxSplitInputs command from the Blocknet wallet Tools->Debug Console , or from the Blocknet wallet Command Line Interface (CLI). Get help on how to use dxsplitinputs by typing dxsplitinputs in the Debug Console and hitting return, or by typing ./blocknet-cli help dxsplitinputs from the Blocknet wallet CLI. You may also want to use the dxSplitAddress command. Get help on how to use the dxsplitaddress command by typing dxsplitaddress in the Debug Console and hitting return, or by typing ./blocknet-cli help dxsplitaddress from the Blocknet wallet CLI. Note: Splitting assets into multiple inputs incurs a transaction fee, and the transaction fee for some chains (e.g. BTC Tx fee ) can be high. Soon, BlockDX will offer to automatically split assets into smaller inputs in the background so you'll always have some \"small change\" on hand, ready to trade. How can I view currently active orders on BlockDX without opening the BlockDX application? Visit the following site: BlockNetMonitor My version of [blockchain] wallet isn\u2019t one of the options to select in the set up process. Can I use this version? Will it still work? Only use wallet versions that are listed. If a version is not listed, it has either not been tested yet or is not compatible. Using a wallet version not listed may result in failed trades or loss of funds. I have Block DX currently working with two wallets. I want to add a third blockchain wallet. Do I need to restart all wallets and go through the set up process again? Yes, at this point in time the setup process needs to be repeated to add additional wallets. However, the blockchains previously selected will be remembered at the initial selection screen when repeating the setup process. The option to go through the setup process again can be found in the upper right corner of BlockDX under MENU->Add & Update Wallets. I am trading with BLOCK/LTC. If I make an order with BUY, does that mean I want to buy BLOCK (and sell LTC)? If I select \u201cSELL,\u201d that means I am selling BLOCK and will receive LTC? If in the BLOCK/LTC market and using BUY order form, you will be buying BLOCK with LTC. Using the SELL order form means you will be selling BLOCK to receive LTC. Do I always need to download and use full blockchains when trading? Block DX is a full decentralized exchange with no central components, which requires the full blockchains to be installed and synced locally to submit the trades as transactions on the network. However, if the assets you want to trade are supported by XLite wallet , you can use XLite and avoid downloading the full blockchains. Do I need to have BLOCK in order to trade? If you are making (placing) an order, no BLOCK is needed. If you are taking (filling) an order, BLOCK is need to cover the trade fee. Read more... If I want to place or accept multiple trades, I need to split my assets into multiple UTXOs within the same address. How do I do that? Splitting assets into multiple UTXOs within an address can be done using the dxSplitInputs command from the Blocknet wallet Tools->Debug Console , or from the Blocknet wallet Command Line Interface (CLI). Get help on how to use dxsplitinputs by typing dxsplitinputs in the Debug Console and hitting return, or by typing ./blocknet-cli help dxsplitinputs from the Blocknet wallet CLI. You may also want to use the dxSplitAddress command. Get help on how to use the dxsplitaddress command by typing dxsplitaddress in the Debug Console and hitting return, or by typing ./blocknet-cli help dxsplitaddress from the Blocknet wallet CLI. I keep getting change addresses after making trades. How do I consolidate them all back into one address and then split them back up into multiple UTXOs again? Combining and splitting of assets (inputs) can be done using the Coin Control functionality within the respective wallet. Why is my balance shown as 0 even though I have funds in it. Some blockchains have Segwit enabled, which uses a different address system. At the moment these new Segwit addresses are not supported so legacy addresses must be used. For example, with Litecoin \u2018L\u2019 addresses should be used instead of \u2018M\u2019 addresses and with Monacoin \u2018M\u2019 addresses should be used instead of \u2018P\u2019 addresses. Why is my balance on Block DX different than in my wallet? The balance reported in Block DX may be less than the amount reported in the respective wallet because the Block DX reports the available balance. This is the balance showing in your wallet minus any immature funds (such as from staking) and funds locked up in open trades. Why is market pricing showing as \u2018N/A\u2019?

Unlike centralized exchanges, Block DX has no deposit, withdrawal, or maker fees other than network fees of the asset being traded. Maker Fee \u00b6 When creating an order on Block DX, there is no fee other than the transaction fee for the network of the asset being sold. This is the same type of fee you would incur if sending this asset to another party. Having no fee to place an order encourages market makers to add liquidity. This also makes it possible for a user to acquire the BLOCK needed to take orders. Taker Fee \u00b6 When accepting an order on Block DX, a static fee of 0.015 BLOCK is charged at the time the order is taken. This fee is charged even if a trade is canceled or fails and is meant to discourage malicious behavior on the network. In addition to the 0.015 BLOCK fee, there is also the transaction fee for the network of the asset being sold. This is the same type of fee you would incur if sending this asset to another party. If the taker asset is BLOCK, there needs to be at least two UTXOs - one or more to cover the 0.015 BLOCK fee and one or more to cover the traded amount. In a future update, there will be a percent-based fee that\u2019s charged when accepting an order, but the details of this are not yet finalized. Note: Taker Fee must be paid from the Blocknet core/native wallet; it cannot be paid with BLOCK stored in XLite. Having no BLOCK in your Blocknet core wallet will result in Insufficient Funds error from BlockDX when taking/accepting orders. For this reason, it's a good idea to keep a few BLOCK in your Blocknet core/native wallet . In a soon-to-be-released version of BlockDX, it will be possible to pay the Taker Fee with BLOCK stored in XLite and it won't even be necessary to run Blocknet core wallet to trade on BlockDX. Acquiring Initial BLOCK \u00b6 When making a new order (i.e. creating a new offer to buy/sell some asset), there is no Exchange Fee on BlockDX. Therefore, it is possible to acquire BLOCK on the BlockDX exchange, even if you don't currently own any BLOCK. You simply make an offer to buy BLOCK on one of the more liquid trading pairs, like BLOCK/LTC, and wait for someone to take your order (i.e. wait for someone to accept your offer). However, if for some reason you can't wait for someone to accept your maker order to buy BLOCK, there are ways to acquire the small amount of BLOCK you need to pay the Taker Fee : Join Blocknet's Discord and ask in the #support or #trading channel if someone would be kind enough to tip you a small amount of BLOCK to get you started trading on BlockDX. Chances are you'll find a generous person who will be happy to send you a tip via the Discord Tip Bot . After receiving a tip you can withdraw your BLOCK from the Discord Server by going to the #tip-bot channel in Blocknet Discord and entering: !withdraw address amount coin where address is your BLOCK address, amount is the amount of BLOCK to withdraw, and coin is BLOCK. Another option for acquiring a small amount of initial BLOCK is to use the faucet . Fees Distribution \u00b6 100% of trade fees are distributed to Service Node operators for supporting the network. // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

Block DX mimics a centralized exchange experience, but enables traders to conduct exchanges directly from their respective wallets instead of through an intermediary. Here are some benefits to using Block DX: Safe Trading - There\u2019s no middlemen or intermediaries. Funds remain in each party\u2019s wallets and are not entrusted to a third party at any stage (non-custodial). Your funds are always in your control. No Accounts - Since it\u2019s decentralized, there are no accounts, signups, or KYC/AML requirements. Lower Fees - Trading fees are lower than those with centralized exchanges, and withdrawal fees are non-existent since trades are conducted directly from the wallets. No Limits - There\u2019s no withdrawal or trade limits, creating greater flexibility.. Trading Pair Freedom - Complete trading pair freedom allowing any digital asset on Block DX to be traded with any other. See the full list of traded assets . Liquidity - Block DX is powered by the Blocknet Protocol. Any service using the protocol will have shared order books and liquidity. Fee Distribution - 100% of trade fees are distributed among BLOCK holders. No Listing Fees - There\u2019s no listing fees for assets to be added to Block DX.

Zero Downtime - Since Block DX is a decentralized exchange powered by the Blocknet Protocol, there is zero downtime and built-in DoS protection. What are Decentralized Exchanges \u00b6 A decentralized exchange is a service enabling counterparties (traders) to exchange one asset for another, without the involvement of any third party as an intermediary. This applies to all components of an exchange (not just settlement), which is the only criteria many 'decentralized' exchanges use to classify themselves as such (i.e. using atomic swaps). To better understand decentralized exchanges, this is a great resource . The term \"decentralized\" refers to matters of control rather than the distribution of processing. The ideal of a decentralized solution is one where no third party is required to act on their behalf in order for a trade to take place. To make an exchange truly decentralized, the following is needed: Decentralized storage of funds Decentralized order books Decentralized order matching Decentralized settlement Decentralized governance Decentralized development (open source) What Aren\u2019t Decentralized Exchanges \u00b6 As stated above, many so-called \u201cdecentralized\u201d exchanges claim to be so because they use atomic swaps for settlement. Since there are more components to an exchange than settlement, (including storage of funds, order books, and order matching) most of these exchanges would more accurately be described as hybrid exchanges since not all of these components are decentralized. An easy way to tell if an exchange has centralized components is if any of the following are true: Requires signup or a login Requires sending funds to another address No control of private keys The development team is able to help out with stuck transactions, deposit/withdrawal issues, etc Derivatives (proxy tokens or colored coins) are used as an intermediary in the exchange // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

Before an asset can be traded on BlockDX, it must be supported by one or more Service Nodes . Blocknet community members have created several web based services to make it easy to discover which assets are currently supported by Service Nodes. Some of these websites actually offer much more information about the Blocknet Network than just how many Service Nodes support each digital asset: To list all coins currently supported by Service Nodes for trading on BlockDX, open Tools->Debug Console in your Blocknet wallet and enter: dxGetNetworkTokens .

BlocknetMonitor (Thank you @walkjivefly !) BlockDXServiceNodes (Thank you @BuzzkillB !) CryptoCoreExplorer (Thank you Telegram user @jimwal !) Raw Volume Data Staking Rewards Calculator Listing Process \u00b6 A Block DX listing holds many benefits beyond just being traded on the exchange. Being listed means the asset has been integrated with the Blocknet Protocol , which powers Block DX, and allows other services to be built utilizing the asset. This extends the demand, utility, and accessibility of the asset to the rest of the ecosystem. Getting listed on Block DX is 100% free. If you would like to have a digital asset listed, the first step is to confirm the asset meets the following requirements. If it doesn't currently meet all these requirements, please work with the developers of the project/asset to ensure they are all met. If you have questions about any of these requirements, please join Blocknet Discord Server and ask your questions in the #block-dx-listing channel. Requirements \u00b6 In order for for a blockchain to be compatible it must support JSON RPC, CLTV atomic swaps, and the following calls: createrawtransaction decoderawtransaction getblock getblockchaininfo (fallback getnetworkinfo, getinfo) getblockhash getnewaddress getrawmempool getrawtransaction gettransaction gettxout listunspent sendrawtransaction signmessage signrawtransaction (or signrawtransactionwithwallet) verifymessage Requirements Met \u00b6 When all of the above requirements are met, you are ready to proceed to the next step in listing your asset. At this point, you basically have two options: Option 1. Do it yourself. This option is 100% free. It could be for you if... You are comfortable working with Git Fork-and-Branch workflow. You are comfortable editing JSON format files like this and creating configuration files like this . You can thoroughly test your asset in BlockDX, and that requires a Service Node to host your asset's native wallet. The easiest way to have a Service Node host your asset's wallet is to own your own Service Node and host it yourself. However, if it's not feasible for you to run your own Service Node, you can probably find someone in the Blocknet Community who will host your asset on their Service Node at a very reasonable rate. (If you get lucky, or if your asset is expected to have high trade volume, you might even find someone to host it for free.) To look for someone to host your asset on their Service Node, join Blocknet Discord Server and ask around in the #block-dx-listing channel. If you meet criteria 1, 2 & 3 above, use Git Fork-and-Branch workflow and follow the instructions given in this README . Option 2. Contract a member of the Blocknet Community to do it for you. This option is obviously not 100% free, but there are Blocknet Community members who are willing to do the work of listing & testing your asset, and also willing to host your asset on their Service Node at very reasonable rates. To pursue this option: join Blocknet Discord Server Navigate to the #block-dx-listing channel in Blocknet Discord. Post a message requesting listing and hosting services, tagging @walkjivefly#7204 in the post. Future Listing Process \u00b6 In the near future, the listing process will become more automated and it will be easier for people to \"Do It Yourself.\" There will be a form where listing applicants fill in all the XBridge Configuration values for their asset, then all the necessary file creations and updates will happen automatically. Note, even with this helpful automation, it will still be necessary to thoroughly test each new asset on BlockDX before it can be listed. Listed Digital Assets \u00b6 Note : Block DX is not compatible with hardware wallets such as Ledger, web wallets such as MyEtherWallet (MEW), or lite wallets such as Jaxx. Desktop Qt wallets must be used. Below is a list of compatible assets and respective wallet versions. .md-typeset__scrollwrap { overflow-x: visible; } .md-typeset .md-typeset__table #bn-table { margin-bottom: -15px; } DO NOT use a wallet version not listed here, it is either not compatible or hasn't been tested.

The exchange has over 100 digital assets trading ( see below ), with the number continuously growing as more are made compatible. There is complete trading pair freedom, meaning any two assets can be traded, totaling to over 5000 tradable pairs. Explore Blocknet Network to see how many Service Nodes currently support each digital asset, and much, much more... Before an asset can be traded on BlockDX, it must be supported by one or more Service Nodes . Blocknet community members have created several web based services to make it easy to discover which assets are currently supported by Service Nodes. Some of these websites actually offer much more information about the Blocknet Network than just how many Service Nodes support each digital asset: To list all coins currently supported by Service Nodes for trading on BlockDX, open Tools->Debug Console in your Blocknet wallet and enter: dxGetNetworkTokens .

Being listed means the asset has been integrated with the Blocknet Protocol , which powers Block DX, and allows other services to be built utilizing the asset. This extends the demand, utility, and accessibility of the asset to the rest of the ecosystem. Getting listed on Block DX is 100% free. If you would like to have a digital asset listed, the first step is to confirm the asset meets the following requirements. If it doesn't currently meet all these requirements, please work with the developers of the project/asset to ensure they are all met. If you have questions about any of these requirements, please join Blocknet Discord Server and ask your questions in the #block-dx-listing channel.","title":"Listing Process"},{"location":"blockdx/listings/#requirements","text":"In order for for a blockchain to be compatible it must support JSON RPC, CLTV atomic swaps, and the following calls: createrawtransaction decoderawtransaction getblock getblockchaininfo (fallback getnetworkinfo, getinfo) getblockhash getnewaddress getrawmempool getrawtransaction gettransaction gettxout listunspent sendrawtransaction signmessage signrawtransaction (or signrawtransactionwithwallet) verifymessage","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"blockdx/listings/#requirements-met","text":"When all of the above requirements are met, you are ready to proceed to the next step in listing your asset. At this point, you basically have two options: Option 1. Do it yourself. This option is 100% free. It could be for you if... You are comfortable working with Git Fork-and-Branch workflow. You are comfortable editing JSON format files like this and creating configuration files like this . You can thoroughly test your asset in BlockDX, and that requires a Service Node to host your asset's native wallet. The easiest way to have a Service Node host your asset's wallet is to own your own Service Node and host it yourself. However, if it's not feasible for you to run your own Service Node, you can probably find someone in the Blocknet Community who will host your asset on their Service Node at a very reasonable rate. (If you get lucky, or if your asset is expected to have high trade volume, you might even find someone to host it for free.) To look for someone to host your asset on their Service Node, join Blocknet Discord Server and ask around in the #block-dx-listing channel. If you meet criteria 1, 2 & 3 above, use Git Fork-and-Branch workflow and follow the instructions given in this README . Option 2. Contract a member of the Blocknet Community to do it for you. This option is obviously not 100% free, but there are Blocknet Community members who are willing to do the work of listing & testing your asset, and also willing to host your asset on their Service Node at very reasonable rates. To pursue this option: join Blocknet Discord Server Navigate to the #block-dx-listing channel in Blocknet Discord.

Follow the guides below to learn how to check your balances, select your market, make orders, take orders, check order status, and view order history. If Block DX has not been setup yet, please follow the setup guide . Acquiring Initial BLOCK \u00b6 When making a new order (i.e. creating a new offer to buy/sell some asset), there is no Exchange Fee on BlockDX. Therefore, it is possible to acquire BLOCK on the BlockDX exchange, even if you don't currently own any BLOCK. You simply make an offer to buy BLOCK on one of the more liquid trading pairs, like BLOCK/LTC, and wait for someone to take your order (i.e. wait for someone to accept your offer). However, if for some reason you can't wait for someone to accept your maker order to buy BLOCK, there are ways to acquire the small amount of BLOCK you need to pay the Taker Fee : Join Blocknet's Discord and ask in the #support or #trading channel if someone would be kind enough to tip you a small amount of BLOCK to get you started trading on BlockDX. Chances are you'll find a generous person who will be happy to send you a tip via the Discord Tip Bot . After receiving a tip you can withdraw your BLOCK from the Discord Server by going to the #tip-bot channel in Blocknet Discord and entering: !withdraw address amount coin where address is your BLOCK address, amount is the amount of BLOCK to withdraw, and coin is BLOCK. Another option for acquiring a small amount of initial BLOCK is to use the faucet . Note: Taker Fee must be paid from the Blocknet core/native wallet; it cannot be paid with BLOCK stored in XLite. Having no BLOCK in your Blocknet core wallet will result in Insufficient Funds error from BlockDX when taking/accepting orders. For this reason, it's a good idea to keep a few BLOCK in your Blocknet core/native wallet . In a soon-to-be-released version of BlockDX, it will be possible to pay the Taker Fee with BLOCK stored in XLite and it won't even be necessary to run Blocknet core wallet to trade on BlockDX. Explore Blocknet Network to see how many Service Nodes currently support each digital asset, and much, much more... Before an asset can be traded on BlockDX, it must be supported by one or more Service Nodes . Blocknet community members have created several web based services to make it easy to discover which assets are currently supported by Service Nodes. Some of these websites actually offer much more information about the Blocknet Network than just how many Service Nodes support each digital asset: To list all coins currently supported by Service Nodes for trading on BlockDX, open Tools->Debug Console in your Blocknet wallet and enter: dxGetNetworkTokens . If using the CLI Blocknet wallet, issue the command, ./blocknet-cli dxGetNetworkTokens from the directory where blocknet-cli is kept. CloudChainsServiceExplorer (Thank you @lucien !) BlocknetMonitor (Thank you @walkjivefly !) BlockDXServiceNodes (Thank you @BuzzkillB !) CryptoCoreExplorer (Thank you Telegram user @jimwal !) Raw Volume Data Staking Rewards Calculator Balances The first thing you want to do when starting Block DX is to check your balances. Balances displays the connected wallets along with the available balance. A connected wallet is one that has been configured and is currently open and unlocked. The available balance is the balance of the funds in a wallet that are not locked up. The Available balance may show a value different than what's displayed in the wallet if: The wallet is locked. You have already made a trade that has locked up funds. You may want to create smaller inputs so that a single trade won't lock up more funds than needed. You can use the dxSplitAddress command from Tools->Debug Console of your Blocknet wallet (or Blocknet CLI) to create smaller inputs. Type help dxSplitAddress in the Debug Console to learn how to use it. Funds aren't in a legacy address. Right now only legacy addresses are compatible. If you are using a Segwit address, please create a new address to send the funds to. If the wallet has been configured via Block DX, then a legacy address will automatically be created when generating a new address. The wallet was not configured . The wallet was not restarted after the configuration. If inputs have been locked via Coin Control. Select Market The market selection tool can be found in the upper-left corned. Click the Select market pair button. A dropdown menu will appear with two lists: the assets of the wallets you have connected and all assets listed on Block DX. From Connected Tokens , select the asset you would like to trade. Select the asset you would like to trade the first asset with. The first asset will be priced in terms of this asset. This asset must have a wallet configured. Select Select to view the chosen market. Market Information Tip: To view currently active BlockDX orders from a browser, visit BlockNetMonitor or BlockDX.co Warning: When opening BlockDX for the first time it can take up to 3 minutes for all currently active orders to display on the screen. This is simply the nature of a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer network. If your XBridge client is connected to very few peers, it can even take slightly longer than 3 minutes. Hint: Check your peer count. Redesign Wallet: Classic Wallet: If your peer count is low, here's how to troubleshoot the issue . Within BlockDX, each market has a price chart, depth chart, and market stats available. Hover over an area of the price or depth chart to show details corresponding to that point on the chart. The market stats are above the price chart and show the last trade price, percent in price change over the last 24 hour rolling period, and volume over the last 24 hour rolling period. The chart has the ability to zoom. To zoom in, click and drag the pointer over the are you want to zoom in on. You can hover over the candles to show the information of each data point in the legend. To exit Zoom Mode , select the Show All button in the upper-right corner of the chart. Make Order \"Making\" an order means creating an offer to buy or sell a specified quantity of an asset for a specified price. Review the trading fees for making orders. At the right side of Block DX you will find an order form. Select either the buy or sell tab. For Quantity to buy/sell (the first input), enter the amount you would like to buy or sell. For Min buy/sell qty (the second input), enter the minimum quantity you are willing to buy/sell in this order. Warning: When selling an asset with a very high transaction fee (e.g. BTC, ETH), or when funding a purchase with an asset that has a high transaction fee, setting your minimum quantity too small can result in unexpectedly high transaction fees deducted from your wallet. More... The reason for this is because XBridge might have to prepare the UTXOs of the outgoing asset to facilitate partial fills of your order. It does this by splitting some of your outgoing asset into N UTXOs , where N is approximately equal to the Quantity to buy/sell divided by the Min buy/sell qty . Each of these N UTXOs will contain Min buy/sell qty worth of the outgoing asset. So, one transaction is required for the splitting, then in the worst case, up to N additional transactions may be required to send the N UTXOs of your outgoing asset to each of the counterparties filling part of your maker order. As of this writing, the average BTC transaction fee is USD $28.97. Therefore, if 5 BTC transaction are required to complete your order, the total transaction cost will be USD $144.85! We plan to have a warning message flash in BlockDX itself if a maker order is being set up which might result in very high transaction fees, but we are warning you here in the docs as well. For most assets, transaction fees are negligible, but for certain assets (e.g. BTC, ETH), they are certainly not negligible. For BTC Price (the third input), enter the price (rate) in terms of BTC for which you would like to trade the first asset of the trading pair you've selected. Note, you can optionally enter Price in terms of the second asset of the trading pair you've selected (LTC in the example image above). The field for entering Price in terms of the second asset is just below BTC Price . Total shows the total amount of the second asset that will be traded for the first asset. In the Address fields, enter the addresses the funds will be going to for each asset. In the above example, buying BLOCK with LTC, the BLOCK Address is the address where the BLOCK you buy will be sent, and the LTC Address is the change address where LTC change from the transaction will be sent. If you don't mind having funds sent to new/empty addresses in your BLOCK and LTC wallets, you can just select Generate New Address to fill in both of these Address fields automatically. However, if you want the asset you're acquiring or the change from the transaction to go to specific addresses in your wallet, you'll need to copy/paste those specific addresses from your wallets into these fields. (For now, these Address fields must be legacy addresses, not Segwit addresses.) See these hints for help finding specific addresses in XLite. Note, the addresses from which the trade is funded are chosen automatically by BlockDX. BlockDX first tries to fund the trade from the address with the smallest UTXO which can cover the expense of the trade. If you are placing a partial fill enabled order , which is an order with a Min buy/sell qty less than Quantity to buy/sell , and you want your order to automatically repost whatever portion of the order remains after a partial fill, leave the Automatically repost order checkbox checked. Review your order. Select the PLACE BUY/SELL ORDER button. The trade will now be visible under Active Orders with Open or some specific progress status shown in the Status column. The Blocknet wallet and the wallets that are being traded out of must remain open and unlocked during trading. If the Blocknet wallet is closed, any open orders will automatically be cancelled. Take Order \"Taking\" an order means accepting an offer to buy or sell a specified quantity of an asset for a specified price. Review the trading fees for taking orders. Note: Taker Fee must be paid from the Blocknet core/native wallet; it cannot be paid with BLOCK stored in XLite. Having no BLOCK in your Blocknet core wallet will result in Insufficient Funds error from BlockDX when taking/accepting orders. On the right side of Block DX you will find the order book. Click on the order you would like to take. The ORDER FORM on the right side of Block DX will auto-populate. If the Quantity to buy/sell field of the ORDER FORM shows a value greater than the Min buy/sell qty field, you can optionally reduce the Quantity to buy/sell value to any value between it's initial value and the value of the Min buy/sell qty field. Make sure Balances shows enough Available Balance to cover the order. In the Address fields, enter the addresses the funds will be going to for each asset. In the above example, selling BLOCK for LTC, the BLOCK Address is the change address where BLOCK change from the transaction will be sent, and the LTC Address is the address where the LTC you acquire from the sale will be sent. If you don't mind having funds sent to new/empty addresses in your BLOCK and LTC wallets, you can just select Generate New Address to fill in both of these Address fields automatically. However, if you want the asset you're acquiring or the change from the transaction to go to specific addresses in your wallet, you'll need to copy/paste those specific addresses from your wallets into these fields. (For now, these address fields must be legacy addresses, not Segwit addresses.) See these hints for help finding specific addresses in XLite. Note, the addresses from which the trade is funded are chosen automatically by BlockDX. BlockDX first tries to fund the trade from the address with the smallest UTXO which can cover the expense of the trade. Review your order. Select the ACCEPT ORDER button. The trade will now be visible under Active Orders . The Blocknet wallet and the wallets that are being traded out of must remain open and unlocked during trading. If the Blocknet wallet is closed, any open orders will automatically be cancelled. Order Status At the bottom of the screen is the Order Status section, where details can be found about the status of an order: If you hover your mouse over the ? symbol in this section, you'll see a chart of every possible status an order can have. The current status is displayed in the Status column on the right. Here is the list of every possible status an order can have: Any orders that are open or in progress can be found in Active Orders . You can hover over the order to read the order state. Any orders that are cancelled, completed, or failed can be found in Inactive Orders Again, you can hover over the order to read the order state. There are different icons to represent each order state. If you have created an order, it will be indicated in the order book with a white dot. The Blocknet wallet and the wallets that are being traded out of must remain open and unlocked during trading. If the Blocknet wallet is closed, any open orders will automatically be cancelled. Order History In the bottom-right area of Block DX you can find the trade history. The trade history information is gathered only for the wallets that are configured. Therefore, the trade history will only show the orders that have been completed since Blocknet wallet and wallets for the currently viewed market have been opened and unlocked. If the Blocknet wallet is restarted, this information will be cleared and no longer visible. Redeem/Refund Funds from Failed or Cancelled Transactions \u00b6 Failed/Cancelled Transactions - How to redeem/refund lost funds. For various reasons, a transaction on BlockDX can occasionally fail or get cancelled and get listed under INACTIVE ORDERS as either Failed : or Cancelled : When this occurs, BlockDX will attempt to refund both parties in the transaction for up to 2 hours. In most cases it will succeed. It's important to keep your Blocknet core wallet open for 2 hours while the refund is attempted because the code which manages the refund currently resides within the Blocknet wallet. In the case of a Failed Order, if the Blocknet wallet is closed before all refunds are completed, or in the rare case that other factors prevent refunds from completing, the order will continue to display a Failed status as shown above, but it will be moved from the INACTIVE ORDERS catagory to the ACTIVE ORDERS category. If this occurs, or if your funds were not returned after 2 hours from a Cancelled order, you'll need to manually redeem your funds by issuing a sendrawtransaction <hexstring> command as follows: Manually Redeem Funds \u00b6 Navigate to your data directory: Windows C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Blocknet\\ Or paste %appdata%\\Blocknet\\ into the File Explorer path field. MacOS ~/Library/Application Support/Blocknet/ Open Finder and in the program menu select Go > Go to Folder... and enter the above path. Linux ~/.blocknet/ In the data directory there is a log-tx subdirectory which contain files named xbridgep2p_YYYYMMDD.log . The hexstring you'll need to use as the parameter for the sendrawtransaction <hexstring> command, will be found in one of the most recent of these .log files. Starting with the most recent .log file, use a text editor (e.g. NotePad on Windows; TextEdit on Mac) to search these files for information about the failed transaction. Search for text that says either, refund transaction for order or redeem counterparty deposit for order , followed shortly thereafter by the text, (submit manually using sendrawtransaction) , followed by a brief description of the attempted transaction (which will include names of the two coins involved, along with amounts and addresses of each coin), followed by a very large hexadecimal string of over 100 characters. This large hexadecimal string is the hexstring you're looking for. If you find two such hexstrings for the failed transaction - one after the text, refund transaction for order , and one after the text, redeem counterparty deposit for order , make a note of both of them. Here is an example of the text patterns you're looking for. In this example, the transaction was a sale of 24.9 GLC at address Dw7WLmrifyH3KSsrtkXPQmQA8PrTmt6nxS in exchange for 1.1952 BLOCK at address Brh4VVgQeVtb1A3qroHittKemfDZjSY9Gm: refund transaction for order 77bb55513d72be752ed68b39980cc2e3e821de0e0318a16a7da131840e1211bf (submit manually using sendrawtransaction) GLC(24.900000 - Dw7WLmrifyH3KSsrtkXPQmQA8PrTmt6nxS) / BLOCK(1.195200 - Brh4VVgQeVtb1A3qroHittKemfDZjSY9Gm) 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 2021-Mar-19 21:56:19 [0x0x70000a9c4000] redeem counterparty deposit for order 77bb55513d72be752ed68b39980cc2e3e821de0e0318a16a7da131840e1211bf (submit manually using sendrawtransaction) GLC(24.900000 - Dw7WLmrifyH3KSsrtkXPQmQA8PrTmt6nxS) / BLOCK(1.195200 - Brh4VVgQeVtb1A3qroHittKemfDZjSY9Gm) 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 The two hexstrings in the example above are: 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 and 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 Continuing with the example above, assuming the funds which were not refunded were GLC coin, you could attempt to recover them manually by opening the GLC core/native wallet, navigating to the Debug Console , then issuing the command: sendrawtransaction <hexstring> where <hexstring> is the large hexstring following the text, refund transaction for order . If you want to make sure this recovery attempt will work, you could use a blockchain explorer to explore the transaction of your funds being sent out of your wallet. If you see the output of that transaction shows, not yet redeemed then you should be able to redeem those funds via sendrawtransaction <hexstring> using the hexstring found after refund transaction for order . If it's not possible to refund the funds that were sent out of your wallet, then the counterparty of the transaction has likely already redeemed/spent those funds. In this case you can try to redeem the counterparty's deposit. In the example above, the counterparty's deposit would have been BLOCK, so to redeem it for yourself, open the BLOCK core/native wallet and issue the sendrawtransaction <hexstring> command from that wallet's Debug Console (or from the CLI if using the Command Line Interface). This time, the <hexstring> to use will be the one following the text, redeem counterparty deposit for order . If you don't have access to the native/core wallet of the coin for which you need to issue a sendrawtransaction command, but that coin is supported by XLite, proceed as follows: Open XLite if it's not already open. Record the necessary details for accessing your coin's XLite wallet as follows: Navigate to the CloudChains settings directory: Windows: C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\AppData\\CloudChains\\settings Or paste %appdata%\\CloudChains\\settings into the File Explorer path field. MacOS: ~/Library/Application Support/CloudChains/settings Open Finder and in the program menu select Go > Go to Folder... and enter the above path. Linux: ~/.config/CloudChains/settings In a text editor, open the config-<coin>.json file of the coin you want to redeem. For example, if you need to manually redeem BTC, open config-BTC.json in a text editor. It will look something like this: { \"rpcPassword\": \"8vCaDSpOKJ8ZhJdukZxaU4Z4NGFFDa9mPy1b-ZT6tHA\", \"fee\": 0.0001, \"rpcUsername\": \"VMvT5inMA0841-458cOxSgz5V0mxJR8J\", \"rpcPort\": 8332, \"feeFlat\": true, \"rpcEnabled\": true, \"addressCount\": 40, \"_ticker\": \"BTC\" } Make a note of the rpcPassword , rpcUsername and rpcPort values in this file. In this example these values are 8vCaDSpOKJ8ZhJdukZxaU4Z4NGFFDa9mPy1b-ZT6tHA , VMvT5inMA0841-458cOxSgz5V0mxJR8J and 8332 , respectively. Open a Terminal window (Mac/Linux) or a Command Prompt (Windows) and issue the following command: curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"method\": \"sendrawtransaction\", \"params\": [\"hexstring\"]}' http://rpcUsername:rpcPassword@127.0.0.1:rpcPort/ where hexstring is the large hexadecimal string mentioned in steps 3-8 above, and rpcUsername , rpcPassword and rpcPort are the values found in step 9->b->iii above. For example, using the values from the examples above, the curl command would look like this: curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"method\": \"sendrawtransaction\", \"params\": [\"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\"]}' http://VMvT5inMA0841-458cOxSgz5V0mxJR8J:8vCaDSpOKJ8ZhJdukZxaU4Z4NGFFDa9mPy1b-ZT6tHA@127.0.0.1:8332/ Note, Windows users may need to install curl if it is not already installed.

Therefore, it is possible to acquire BLOCK on the BlockDX exchange, even if you don't currently own any BLOCK. You simply make an offer to buy BLOCK on one of the more liquid trading pairs, like BLOCK/LTC, and wait for someone to take your order (i.e. wait for someone to accept your offer). However, if for some reason you can't wait for someone to accept your maker order to buy BLOCK, there are ways to acquire the small amount of BLOCK you need to pay the Taker Fee : Join Blocknet's Discord and ask in the #support or #trading channel if someone would be kind enough to tip you a small amount of BLOCK to get you started trading on BlockDX. Chances are you'll find a generous person who will be happy to send you a tip via the Discord Tip Bot . After receiving a tip you can withdraw your BLOCK from the Discord Server by going to the #tip-bot channel in Blocknet Discord and entering: !withdraw address amount coin where address is your BLOCK address, amount is the amount of BLOCK to withdraw, and coin is BLOCK. Another option for acquiring a small amount of initial BLOCK is to use the faucet . Note: Taker Fee must be paid from the Blocknet core/native wallet; it cannot be paid with BLOCK stored in XLite. Having no BLOCK in your Blocknet core wallet will result in Insufficient Funds error from BlockDX when taking/accepting orders. For this reason, it's a good idea to keep a few BLOCK in your Blocknet core/native wallet . In a soon-to-be-released version of BlockDX, it will be possible to pay the Taker Fee with BLOCK stored in XLite and it won't even be necessary to run Blocknet core wallet to trade on BlockDX. Explore Blocknet Network to see how many Service Nodes currently support each digital asset, and much, much more... Before an asset can be traded on BlockDX, it must be supported by one or more Service Nodes . Blocknet community members have created several web based services to make it easy to discover which assets are currently supported by Service Nodes. Some of these websites actually offer much more information about the Blocknet Network than just how many Service Nodes support each digital asset: To list all coins currently supported by Service Nodes for trading on BlockDX, open Tools->Debug Console in your Blocknet wallet and enter: dxGetNetworkTokens .

Raw Volume Data Staking Rewards Calculator Balances The first thing you want to do when starting Block DX is to check your balances. Balances displays the connected wallets along with the available balance. A connected wallet is one that has been configured and is currently open and unlocked. The available balance is the balance of the funds in a wallet that are not locked up. The Available balance may show a value different than what's displayed in the wallet if: The wallet is locked. You have already made a trade that has locked up funds. You may want to create smaller inputs so that a single trade won't lock up more funds than needed. You can use the dxSplitAddress command from Tools->Debug Console of your Blocknet wallet (or Blocknet CLI) to create smaller inputs. Type help dxSplitAddress in the Debug Console to learn how to use it. Funds aren't in a legacy address. Right now only legacy addresses are compatible. If you are using a Segwit address, please create a new address to send the funds to. If the wallet has been configured via Block DX, then a legacy address will automatically be created when generating a new address. The wallet was not configured . The wallet was not restarted after the configuration. If inputs have been locked via Coin Control. Select Market The market selection tool can be found in the upper-left corned. Click the Select market pair button. A dropdown menu will appear with two lists: the assets of the wallets you have connected and all assets listed on Block DX. From Connected Tokens , select the asset you would like to trade. Select the asset you would like to trade the first asset with. The first asset will be priced in terms of this asset. This asset must have a wallet configured. Select Select to view the chosen market. Market Information Tip: To view currently active BlockDX orders from a browser, visit BlockNetMonitor or BlockDX.co Warning: When opening BlockDX for the first time it can take up to 3 minutes for all currently active orders to display on the screen. This is simply the nature of a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer network. If your XBridge client is connected to very few peers, it can even take slightly longer than 3 minutes. Hint: Check your peer count. Redesign Wallet: Classic Wallet: If your peer count is low, here's how to troubleshoot the issue . Within BlockDX, each market has a price chart, depth chart, and market stats available. Hover over an area of the price or depth chart to show details corresponding to that point on the chart. The market stats are above the price chart and show the last trade price, percent in price change over the last 24 hour rolling period, and volume over the last 24 hour rolling period. The chart has the ability to zoom. To zoom in, click and drag the pointer over the are you want to zoom in on. You can hover over the candles to show the information of each data point in the legend. To exit Zoom Mode , select the Show All button in the upper-right corner of the chart. Make Order \"Making\" an order means creating an offer to buy or sell a specified quantity of an asset for a specified price. Review the trading fees for making orders. At the right side of Block DX you will find an order form. Select either the buy or sell tab. For Quantity to buy/sell (the first input), enter the amount you would like to buy or sell. For Min buy/sell qty (the second input), enter the minimum quantity you are willing to buy/sell in this order. Warning: When selling an asset with a very high transaction fee (e.g. BTC, ETH), or when funding a purchase with an asset that has a high transaction fee, setting your minimum quantity too small can result in unexpectedly high transaction fees deducted from your wallet. More... The reason for this is because XBridge might have to prepare the UTXOs of the outgoing asset to facilitate partial fills of your order. It does this by splitting some of your outgoing asset into N UTXOs , where N is approximately equal to the Quantity to buy/sell divided by the Min buy/sell qty . Each of these N UTXOs will contain Min buy/sell qty worth of the outgoing asset. So, one transaction is required for the splitting, then in the worst case, up to N additional transactions may be required to send the N UTXOs of your outgoing asset to each of the counterparties filling part of your maker order. As of this writing, the average BTC transaction fee is USD $28.97. Therefore, if 5 BTC transaction are required to complete your order, the total transaction cost will be USD $144.85! We plan to have a warning message flash in BlockDX itself if a maker order is being set up which might result in very high transaction fees, but we are warning you here in the docs as well. For most assets, transaction fees are negligible, but for certain assets (e.g. BTC, ETH), they are certainly not negligible. For BTC Price (the third input), enter the price (rate) in terms of BTC for which you would like to trade the first asset of the trading pair you've selected. Note, you can optionally enter Price in terms of the second asset of the trading pair you've selected (LTC in the example image above). The field for entering Price in terms of the second asset is just below BTC Price . Total shows the total amount of the second asset that will be traded for the first asset. In the Address fields, enter the addresses the funds will be going to for each asset. In the above example, buying BLOCK with LTC, the BLOCK Address is the address where the BLOCK you buy will be sent, and the LTC Address is the change address where LTC change from the transaction will be sent. If you don't mind having funds sent to new/empty addresses in your BLOCK and LTC wallets, you can just select Generate New Address to fill in both of these Address fields automatically. However, if you want the asset you're acquiring or the change from the transaction to go to specific addresses in your wallet, you'll need to copy/paste those specific addresses from your wallets into these fields. (For now, these Address fields must be legacy addresses, not Segwit addresses.) See these hints for help finding specific addresses in XLite. Note, the addresses from which the trade is funded are chosen automatically by BlockDX. BlockDX first tries to fund the trade from the address with the smallest UTXO which can cover the expense of the trade. If you are placing a partial fill enabled order , which is an order with a Min buy/sell qty less than Quantity to buy/sell , and you want your order to automatically repost whatever portion of the order remains after a partial fill, leave the Automatically repost order checkbox checked. Review your order. Select the PLACE BUY/SELL ORDER button. The trade will now be visible under Active Orders with Open or some specific progress status shown in the Status column. The Blocknet wallet and the wallets that are being traded out of must remain open and unlocked during trading. If the Blocknet wallet is closed, any open orders will automatically be cancelled. Take Order \"Taking\" an order means accepting an offer to buy or sell a specified quantity of an asset for a specified price. Review the trading fees for taking orders. Note: Taker Fee must be paid from the Blocknet core/native wallet; it cannot be paid with BLOCK stored in XLite. Having no BLOCK in your Blocknet core wallet will result in Insufficient Funds error from BlockDX when taking/accepting orders. On the right side of Block DX you will find the order book. Click on the order you would like to take. The ORDER FORM on the right side of Block DX will auto-populate. If the Quantity to buy/sell field of the ORDER FORM shows a value greater than the Min buy/sell qty field, you can optionally reduce the Quantity to buy/sell value to any value between it's initial value and the value of the Min buy/sell qty field. Make sure Balances shows enough Available Balance to cover the order. In the Address fields, enter the addresses the funds will be going to for each asset. In the above example, selling BLOCK for LTC, the BLOCK Address is the change address where BLOCK change from the transaction will be sent, and the LTC Address is the address where the LTC you acquire from the sale will be sent. If you don't mind having funds sent to new/empty addresses in your BLOCK and LTC wallets, you can just select Generate New Address to fill in both of these Address fields automatically. However, if you want the asset you're acquiring or the change from the transaction to go to specific addresses in your wallet, you'll need to copy/paste those specific addresses from your wallets into these fields. (For now, these address fields must be legacy addresses, not Segwit addresses.) See these hints for help finding specific addresses in XLite. Note, the addresses from which the trade is funded are chosen automatically by BlockDX. BlockDX first tries to fund the trade from the address with the smallest UTXO which can cover the expense of the trade. Review your order. Select the ACCEPT ORDER button. The trade will now be visible under Active Orders . The Blocknet wallet and the wallets that are being traded out of must remain open and unlocked during trading. If the Blocknet wallet is closed, any open orders will automatically be cancelled. Order Status At the bottom of the screen is the Order Status section, where details can be found about the status of an order: If you hover your mouse over the ? symbol in this section, you'll see a chart of every possible status an order can have. The current status is displayed in the Status column on the right. Here is the list of every possible status an order can have: Any orders that are open or in progress can be found in Active Orders . You can hover over the order to read the order state. Any orders that are cancelled, completed, or failed can be found in Inactive Orders Again, you can hover over the order to read the order state. There are different icons to represent each order state. If you have created an order, it will be indicated in the order book with a white dot. The Blocknet wallet and the wallets that are being traded out of must remain open and unlocked during trading. If the Blocknet wallet is closed, any open orders will automatically be cancelled. Order History In the bottom-right area of Block DX you can find the trade history. The trade history information is gathered only for the wallets that are configured. Therefore, the trade history will only show the orders that have been completed since Blocknet wallet and wallets for the currently viewed market have been opened and unlocked. If the Blocknet wallet is restarted, this information will be cleared and no longer visible.","title":"Acquiring Initial BLOCK"},{"location":"blockdx/trading/#redeemrefund-funds-from-failed-or-cancelled-transactions","text":"Failed/Cancelled Transactions - How to redeem/refund lost funds. For various reasons, a transaction on BlockDX can occasionally fail or get cancelled and get listed under INACTIVE ORDERS as either Failed : or Cancelled : When this occurs, BlockDX will attempt to refund both parties in the transaction for up to 2 hours. In most cases it will succeed. It's important to keep your Blocknet core wallet open for 2 hours while the refund is attempted because the code which manages the refund currently resides within the Blocknet wallet. In the case of a Failed Order, if the Blocknet wallet is closed before all refunds are completed, or in the rare case that other factors prevent refunds from completing, the order will continue to display a Failed status as shown above, but it will be moved from the INACTIVE ORDERS catagory to the ACTIVE ORDERS category. If this occurs, or if your funds were not returned after 2 hours from a Cancelled order, you'll need to manually redeem your funds by issuing a sendrawtransaction <hexstring> command as follows:","title":"Redeem/Refund Funds from Failed or Cancelled Transactions"},{"location":"blockdx/trading/#manually-redeem-funds","text":"Navigate to your data directory: Windows C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Blocknet\\ Or paste %appdata%\\Blocknet\\ into the File Explorer path field.

Linux ~/.blocknet/ In the data directory there is a log-tx subdirectory which contain files named xbridgep2p_YYYYMMDD.log . The hexstring you'll need to use as the parameter for the sendrawtransaction <hexstring> command, will be found in one of the most recent of these .log files. Starting with the most recent .log file, use a text editor (e.g. NotePad on Windows; TextEdit on Mac) to search these files for information about the failed transaction. Search for text that says either, refund transaction for order or redeem counterparty deposit for order , followed shortly thereafter by the text, (submit manually using sendrawtransaction) , followed by a brief description of the attempted transaction (which will include names of the two coins involved, along with amounts and addresses of each coin), followed by a very large hexadecimal string of over 100 characters. This large hexadecimal string is the hexstring you're looking for. If you find two such hexstrings for the failed transaction - one after the text, refund transaction for order , and one after the text, redeem counterparty deposit for order , make a note of both of them.

If you want to make sure this recovery attempt will work, you could use a blockchain explorer to explore the transaction of your funds being sent out of your wallet. If you see the output of that transaction shows, not yet redeemed then you should be able to redeem those funds via sendrawtransaction <hexstring> using the hexstring found after refund transaction for order . If it's not possible to refund the funds that were sent out of your wallet, then the counterparty of the transaction has likely already redeemed/spent those funds. In this case you can try to redeem the counterparty's deposit. In the example above, the counterparty's deposit would have been BLOCK, so to redeem it for yourself, open the BLOCK core/native wallet and issue the sendrawtransaction <hexstring> command from that wallet's Debug Console (or from the CLI if using the Command Line Interface). This time, the <hexstring> to use will be the one following the text, redeem counterparty deposit for order . If you don't have access to the native/core wallet of the coin for which you need to issue a sendrawtransaction command, but that coin is supported by XLite, proceed as follows: Open XLite if it's not already open. Record the necessary details for accessing your coin's XLite wallet as follows: Navigate to the CloudChains settings directory: Windows: C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\AppData\\CloudChains\\settings Or paste %appdata%\\CloudChains\\settings into the File Explorer path field. MacOS: ~/Library/Application Support/CloudChains/settings Open Finder and in the program menu select Go > Go to Folder... and enter the above path. Linux: ~/.config/CloudChains/settings In a text editor, open the config-<coin>.json file of the coin you want to redeem. For example, if you need to manually redeem BTC, open config-BTC.json in a text editor. It will look something like this: { \"rpcPassword\": \"8vCaDSpOKJ8ZhJdukZxaU4Z4NGFFDa9mPy1b-ZT6tHA\", \"fee\": 0.0001, \"rpcUsername\": \"VMvT5inMA0841-458cOxSgz5V0mxJR8J\", \"rpcPort\": 8332, \"feeFlat\": true, \"rpcEnabled\": true, \"addressCount\": 40, \"_ticker\": \"BTC\" } Make a note of the rpcPassword , rpcUsername and rpcPort values in this file. In this example these values are 8vCaDSpOKJ8ZhJdukZxaU4Z4NGFFDa9mPy1b-ZT6tHA , VMvT5inMA0841-458cOxSgz5V0mxJR8J and 8332 , respectively. Open a Terminal window (Mac/Linux) or a Command Prompt (Windows) and issue the following command: curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"method\": \"sendrawtransaction\", \"params\": [\"hexstring\"]}' http://rpcUsername:rpcPassword@127.0.0.1:rpcPort/ where hexstring is the large hexadecimal string mentioned in steps 3-8 above, and rpcUsername , rpcPassword and rpcPort are the values found in step 9->b->iii above. For example, using the values from the examples above, the curl command would look like this: curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"method\": \"sendrawtransaction\", \"params\": [\"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\"]}' http://VMvT5inMA0841-458cOxSgz5V0mxJR8J:8vCaDSpOKJ8ZhJdukZxaU4Z4NGFFDa9mPy1b-ZT6tHA@127.0.0.1:8332/ Note, Windows users may need to install curl if it is not already installed.

The ITO raised just short of 970 BTC in various assets worth $340,000 at the time. The project burned through the ITO funds mainly because the assets held lost value and BTC being in a bear market. Blocknet was then privately funded by a few generous community members and the main developer. This was unsustainable and the investor community was asking for a change. Various funding models were considered but a decision for masternodes and a more decentralized governance concept was chosen. The market reacted well to this decision. Blocknet\u2019s masternodes are called Service Nodes as they deliver additional architectural functionality compared to classic masternodes. Implementing masternodes was not without problems. An exploit in the forked code that had been the basis for Blocknet\u2019s Service Nodes caused a small group to gain an abnormally large staking reward. The developer group managed to get hold of a large share of these funds and lock the rest in a fork. The 110,000 BLOCK redeemed now sits in a community fund, in a trusted setup where 4 out of 7 core team members to the project are required to spend the funds. This is an unfair responsibility and risk to put on those members so this proposal will include different scenarios of how to move ahead from here. A simple ledger of the funds can be found here . The current governance model by Service Nodes can be found here . In short, every 43,200 blocks on the Blocknet blockchain, Service Nodes can choose to mint up to a maximum of 40,000 new tokens. These can then be allocated to fund development in the form of proposals. Defining the Blocknet Project as an Entity \u00b6 The business layer of Blocknet is an interoperability protocol to facilitate interaction between blockchains, either through exchange on the XBridge decentralized exchange component or through cross-chain communication with the XRouter blockchain packet routing component. XBridge trades generate fees charged in BLOCK for exchanges completed with the protocol, and XRouter calls generate fees charged in BLOCK for routing packets with the protocol. The entirety of these fees are transferred to the Service Nodes responsible for providing these services. The idea is that the need for BLOCK required to settle the trade fees and submit cross-chain calls will create buy pressure on BLOCK, driving the price up. Furthermore, the redistribution of BLOCK from the market to service providers will function comparable to a dividend program incentivizing further service to the network by stakers and Service Nodes. Therefore, it can be argued that Blocknet has an earnings stream for the network service providers. Development of Bocknet is, as described in Background , funded by Service Nodes choosing to add additional circulation by minting BLOCK. As the price of BLOCK increases due to added value from development, so will the relative purchasing power of the, up to, 40,000 BLOCK minted every month. In 2014 Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, posted what he called \u201cDAOs, DACs, DAs and More: An Incomplete Terminology Guide\u201d to the Ethereum blog. According to Vitalik, the difference between a DAO and a DAC is whether the project pays rewards. By this definition Blocknet would classify as a DAC, a Decentralized Autonomous Corporation. It\u2019s important to understand that Blocknet doesn\u2019t have a direct link between what could be considered a revenue stream and expenditures to freelance contractors, such as developers and supporting activities. It is the Service Nodes and stakers of Blocknet that earn revenue in the form of BLOCK rewards redistributed for participation in providing a service to the network. The above model is speculated to sustain organic growth of Blocknet. However, what Blocknet lacks is a means to grow inorganically. The Superblock has a hard-coded maximum output of 40,000 BLOCK per month. Looking at it from a different perspective: The nature of Blocknet\u2019s cost has so far mostly been investing. Operational costs has been related to the edge of the network where node holders have had expenses for keeping the systems online. However, as the project has grown, proposals for the 40,000 BLOCK have taken on a nature more akin to monthly contracts rather than one time fees. Hiring contractors for a month's work allows for greater flexibility within that month to add value to the project where it might be required. Instead of proactively having to scope what has to be done, the contractors can instead reactively prioritize urgent matters. Quite early on the community speculated a future need for operational staff: A support function that could help to network users with whatever issues they might face. Not having this would put Blocknet behind in the end-user experience that centralized competitors offer. However, Blocknet was envisioned to function by contracts being proposed and filled by freelancers. Practically, the knowledge assets generated in the project have made interchanging resources inefficient. Knowledge assets are not managed into shareable objects and rather stay as tacit knowledge in the minds of those involved. Process thinking is being applied to combat this, firstly in the supporting functions of marketing and media. These are expected to submit KPIs comparing Blocknet to market trends. Also formulating plans and visions so that the Service Nodes can monitor the performance of the team and govern accordingly. Eventually the team lead of each function should be more concerned with scaling their team (up and down), defining methods to work by rather than being hands-on themselves. Example of the great methods being developed in marketing: KPIs and Marketing Plan Marketing recruiting working instructions Governance Structure \u00b6 The governance structure of Blocknet should primarily ensure that the flow of money and flow of information run as decentralized, transparent and trustless as possible. Even a decentralized organization like Blocknet requires an operating model by describing the organizational structure, key processes and system, facilities, and locations. As previously stated, the objective of this paper is for Blocknet to scale while keeping it decentralized and not classified as a security. Legal Compliance \u00b6 To be added in a later update.

Proposals for Superblocks \u00b6 Proposal Submission Flow \u00b6 Submission of Proposal to Network \u00b6 Instructions: Ensure there is a minimum of 11 BLOCK in your wallet to pay for the proposal submission fee (10 BLOCK fee + transaction fee). This fee should be added to the proposal amount(in a later step) so that you are reimbursed upon acceptance of the proposal. Submit a pre-proposal to the relevant Superblock thread in the proposal forum with the following information: Proposal name as will be submitted to the network (18 character limit) Example : Qt-Exchange-Widget What is being proposed Rationale and further explanation of proposal & background info Technical explanation/agenda of feature/proposal (if applicable) Estimated time for components in the proposal (if applicable) Teams/person undertaking the work Cost assessment Are these expenses coming from the Superblock or community funds? Which community fund is it coming from? Fund custodians By sticking to a similar format your proposal should accurately convey the relevant information, notably: what is being proposed, why it is being proposed, how much it will cost, and where the funds will go once created. After allowing some time for the proposal to be reviewed in the pre-proposal thread, the final proposal with any edits should be submitted to the relevant final proposal Superblock thread in the proposal forum. Once a final proposal is submitted to the forum, copy the post URL and create a shortened URL using Google's URL shortener: https://goo.gl/ Open the wallet In the program menu, go to Window > Console . The debug console will open in a new window. The voting command uses the following command structure (all one line): Format : mnbudget prepare [PROPOSAL NAME] [URL] [PAYMENT COUNT] [SUPERBLOCK BLOCK] [ADDRESS] [AMOUNT] PROPOSAL NAME = The name of the proposal without spaces (18 character limit) URL = The shortened URL for the proposal link created PAYMENT COUNT = Amount of recurring payments to occur for the quantity in [AMOUNT] SUPERBLOCK BLOCK = The Superblock block count payments will start at ADDRESS = The BLOCK address to receive payments to AMOUNT = The amount to be compensated upon proposal approval Example : mnbudget prepare privacy-mixer https://goo.gl/xxxxxxx 1 129600 Bxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 100 Submit the command and leave the debug console open. A transaction hash (tx hash) will be returned from the \u2018 prepare \u2019 command above. Example : 1007f6f8055da51255285789554e2407eec5ec5521a5549df35543c5545ef050147 Now that you have the transaction hash, after 6 confirmations the proposal must be submitted using the following command. It's the previous command with prepare replaced with submit and with the transaction hash appended to the end. Example : mnbudget submit privacy-mixer https://goo.gl/xxxxxxx 1 129600 Bxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 100 1007f6f8055da51255285789554e2407eec5ec5521a5549df35543c5545ef050147 Verify that the proposal has been properly submitted by typing the following command and looking for the proposal: mnbudget show Proposal Vote Flow \u00b6 For a proposal to pass and receive funding: The amount requested must be 40,000 BLOCK or less. Votes in favor must be greater than votes against by at least 10% of the total number of Service Nodes. The proposals that pass are sorted in a descending order list by the sum of yes votes minus no votes. If multiple proposals have an equal sum of yes votes minus no votes, those are sorted randomly. If there are not enough funds remaining in the Superblock for a proposal to be paid out, it is skipped(not paid out), and the next proposal in the passing list is checked for qualification. Multi-month proposals are voted on each month and are treated in the same manner as normal proposals in the ordered list. Voting Turnout Yays Required Max Nays Allowed 100% 55% 45% 80% 56.25% 43.75% 40% 62.5% 37.5% 20% 75% 25% 10% 100% 0% <10% cannot pass cannot pass Notes for expansion in further updates: Creating a formalized BIP processes that supports and nourishes ideas. Peer-reviewing ideas and suggesting improvements before they are submitted, but never censorship. A proposal that submits the fee to be voted on should always be added for voting.

Conclusion: A proposed future Governance Model for Blocknet \u00b6 Around 90% of blockchain projects die, either due to being blatant scams or never achieving a functioning organizational form. Blocknet is ad hoc yet reaching a more mature organizational form, but to enter the next stage, Blocknet will have to become more structured. By maintaining decentralization throughout the organization and by using process documentation, it's possible to have an aligned organization without bottlenecking key resources. Contributing to Blocknet then becomes more tangible as it allows contributors to approach the non-technical parts of Blocknet as open-source.","title":"Blocknet Governance Model"},{"location":"governance/-governance-model/#blocknet-governance-model","text":"","title":"Blocknet Governance Model"},{"location":"governance/-governance-model/#background","text":"Blocknet is a blockchain interoperability project launched in 2014 by ITO.

Various funding models were considered but a decision for masternodes and a more decentralized governance concept was chosen. The market reacted well to this decision. Blocknet\u2019s masternodes are called Service Nodes as they deliver additional architectural functionality compared to classic masternodes. Implementing masternodes was not without problems. An exploit in the forked code that had been the basis for Blocknet\u2019s Service Nodes caused a small group to gain an abnormally large staking reward. The developer group managed to get hold of a large share of these funds and lock the rest in a fork. The 110,000 BLOCK redeemed now sits in a community fund, in a trusted setup where 4 out of 7 core team members to the project are required to spend the funds. This is an unfair responsibility and risk to put on those members so this proposal will include different scenarios of how to move ahead from here. A simple ledger of the funds can be found here . The current governance model by Service Nodes can be found here . In short, every 43,200 blocks on the Blocknet blockchain, Service Nodes can choose to mint up to a maximum of 40,000 new tokens. These can then be allocated to fund development in the form of proposals.","title":"Background"},{"location":"governance/-governance-model/#defining-the-blocknet-project-as-an-entity","text":"The business layer of Blocknet is an interoperability protocol to facilitate interaction between blockchains, either through exchange on the XBridge decentralized exchange component or through cross-chain communication with the XRouter blockchain packet routing component. XBridge trades generate fees charged in BLOCK for exchanges completed with the protocol, and XRouter calls generate fees charged in BLOCK for routing packets with the protocol. The entirety of these fees are transferred to the Service Nodes responsible for providing these services. The idea is that the need for BLOCK required to settle the trade fees and submit cross-chain calls will create buy pressure on BLOCK, driving the price up. Furthermore, the redistribution of BLOCK from the market to service providers will function comparable to a dividend program incentivizing further service to the network by stakers and Service Nodes. Therefore, it can be argued that Blocknet has an earnings stream for the network service providers. Development of Bocknet is, as described in Background , funded by Service Nodes choosing to add additional circulation by minting BLOCK. As the price of BLOCK increases due to added value from development, so will the relative purchasing power of the, up to, 40,000 BLOCK minted every month. In 2014 Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, posted what he called \u201cDAOs, DACs, DAs and More: An Incomplete Terminology Guide\u201d to the Ethereum blog. According to Vitalik, the difference between a DAO and a DAC is whether the project pays rewards. By this definition Blocknet would classify as a DAC, a Decentralized Autonomous Corporation. It\u2019s important to understand that Blocknet doesn\u2019t have a direct link between what could be considered a revenue stream and expenditures to freelance contractors, such as developers and supporting activities. It is the Service Nodes and stakers of Blocknet that earn revenue in the form of BLOCK rewards redistributed for participation in providing a service to the network. The above model is speculated to sustain organic growth of Blocknet. However, what Blocknet lacks is a means to grow inorganically. The Superblock has a hard-coded maximum output of 40,000 BLOCK per month. Looking at it from a different perspective: The nature of Blocknet\u2019s cost has so far mostly been investing. Operational costs has been related to the edge of the network where node holders have had expenses for keeping the systems online. However, as the project has grown, proposals for the 40,000 BLOCK have taken on a nature more akin to monthly contracts rather than one time fees. Hiring contractors for a month's work allows for greater flexibility within that month to add value to the project where it might be required. Instead of proactively having to scope what has to be done, the contractors can instead reactively prioritize urgent matters. Quite early on the community speculated a future need for operational staff: A support function that could help to network users with whatever issues they might face. Not having this would put Blocknet behind in the end-user experience that centralized competitors offer. However, Blocknet was envisioned to function by contracts being proposed and filled by freelancers. Practically, the knowledge assets generated in the project have made interchanging resources inefficient. Knowledge assets are not managed into shareable objects and rather stay as tacit knowledge in the minds of those involved. Process thinking is being applied to combat this, firstly in the supporting functions of marketing and media. These are expected to submit KPIs comparing Blocknet to market trends. Also formulating plans and visions so that the Service Nodes can monitor the performance of the team and govern accordingly. Eventually the team lead of each function should be more concerned with scaling their team (up and down), defining methods to work by rather than being hands-on themselves. Example of the great methods being developed in marketing: KPIs and Marketing Plan Marketing recruiting working instructions","title":"Defining the Blocknet Project as an Entity"},{"location":"governance/-governance-model/#governance-structure","text":"The governance structure of Blocknet should primarily ensure that the flow of money and flow of information run as decentralized, transparent and trustless as possible.

Create a proposal, embedding Markdown Text as desired for formatting, which clearly and accurately conveys the following relevant information: Proposal name using only alpha-numerics ( example : Qt-Exchange-Widget). Note, it's often useful to include the applicable SuperBlock number in the name, especially if you submit similar proposals each SuperBlock.

Continue on to submit the proposal from the Qt wallet or to submit the proposal via command line . (Optional) Once the proposal has been submitted, your proposal will be assigned a proposal hash (a large string of numbers and letter representing your proposal). If using the Command Line Interface, the proposal hash will be returned after submitting the proposal via the createproposal command. The proposal hash will be the xxxx value in the \"hash\":\"xxxx\", value returned. You can also display proposal hash and other information about all upcoming proposals as follows: In Blocknet Qt/GUI wallet, go to Tools->Debug Console Type listproposals <last_SB_number + 1> where <last_SB_number + 1> is 1 more than the number of the previous SuperBlock . Or from CLI: ./blocknet-cli listproposals <last_SB_number + 1> Once you have your proposal's proposal hash , you can now edit your post in the Proposal Forum to add the command for voting for your proposal from the command line, which is: vote [proposal hash] yes For example, vote 8333cdf2fbfe25a78e08876b6ed1bc5cd09efa9edbdf491d2a06e43faf252698 yes Submit from the Qt Wallet \u00b6 Submit using the redesigned wallet Open and sync the Blocknet wallet .

Tip: Before creating a new proposal, it's recommended to review previous proposals in the Proposal Forum to get an idea of what is generally expected and acceptable. At the Blocknet Proposal Forum , you'll see this at the top of the page: Select Draft Proposal at the top left, then click + New Topic at the top right of the screen. Create a proposal, embedding Markdown Text as desired for formatting, which clearly and accurately conveys the following relevant information: Proposal name using only alpha-numerics ( example : Qt-Exchange-Widget). Note, it's often useful to include the applicable SuperBlock number in the name, especially if you submit similar proposals each SuperBlock. Previous work relevant to this proposal What is being proposed Rationale and further explanation of proposal & background info Technical explanation/agenda of feature/proposal Estimated time for components in the proposal Teams/person undertaking and responsible for the work Cost assessment Fund custodians Once the Draft Proposal has been submitted and posted to the forum, copy the post's URL and create a shortened URL at https://bit.ly/ (The full URL can be used in place of bit.ly shortened version if the total amount of text entered for the proposal is not large.) Continue on to submit the proposal from the Qt wallet or to submit the proposal via command line . (Optional) Once the proposal has been submitted, your proposal will be assigned a proposal hash (a large string of numbers and letter representing your proposal). If using the Command Line Interface, the proposal hash will be returned after submitting the proposal via the createproposal command. The proposal hash will be the xxxx value in the \"hash\":\"xxxx\", value returned. You can also display proposal hash and other information about all upcoming proposals as follows: In Blocknet Qt/GUI wallet, go to Tools->Debug Console Type listproposals <last_SB_number + 1> where <last_SB_number + 1> is 1 more than the number of the previous SuperBlock . Or from CLI: ./blocknet-cli listproposals <last_SB_number + 1> Once you have your proposal's proposal hash , you can now edit your post in the Proposal Forum to add the command for voting for your proposal from the command line, which is: vote [proposal hash] yes For example, vote 8333cdf2fbfe25a78e08876b6ed1bc5cd09efa9edbdf491d2a06e43faf252698 yes","title":"Create A Proposal"},{"location":"governance/create-proposal/#submit-from-the-qt-wallet","text":"Submit using the redesigned wallet Open and sync the Blocknet wallet .

Decentralization defines the template for group decision-making and is self-managed through a 2-part governing system consisting of Service Nodes and Superblocks. There is also additional funding aside from the Superblock, which is explained under Community Funds . Superblock \u00b6 Superblocks are special blocks that occur every 43,200 blocks, or approximately once each month. On each Superblock, up to a maximum of 40,000 BLOCK can be minted to fund the project. It's important to note that only the total amount of BLOCK requested by passing proposals will be minted, so if no proposals pass then no BLOCK will be minted in the Superblock . To request funding from a Superblock, a proposal must be submitted to the network prior to the Superblock. Service Node operators then have the opportunity to review these proposals and vote on each proposal with either a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 to approve or decline funding. Passing Criteria \u00b6 For a proposal to pass and receive funding: 25% of all Service Nodes operating in this Superblock is the minumum number of votes that must have been cast on the proposal (for or against) 60% of votes must be \"yes\" (in favor) At this point all valid proposals are prioritized according to these requirements: Descending order by the sum of yes votes minus no votes Descending order by amount of yes votes Sequential order by block height the proposal is submitted (earlier blocks are first) The Superblock is then filled by as many valid proposals as possible according to the priority defined by (a), (b), and (c) If there are not enough funds remaining in the Superblock for a proposal to fit, it is skipped (not paid out), and the next proposal in the priority list is checked for qualification Superblock Value Calculator \u00b6 BLOCK dollar value: $ Superblock value: $ 0 function sb_calculate() { var price = document.getElementById(\"bn_sb_input\").value; var amount = 40000; var value = Number(price)*amount; document.getElementById(\"bn_sb_output\").innerHTML = sb_numberPretty(value); } function sb_numberPretty(num) { var number = num.toString().split('.'); var prettyNum; if (number[0] > 0) { number[0] = number[0].replace(/\\B(?=(\\d{3})+(?!\\d))/g, \",\"); if (number[1]) { number[1] = number[1].substr(0,2); } prettyNum = number.join(\".\"); } else { prettyNum = Math.round(num*1000000)/1000000; } return prettyNum; } function sb_getPrice() { var url = \"https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/blocknet/tickers\"; sb_ajax(url, true).then(function(data) { if (data[\"tickers\"][0][\"converted_last\"][\"usd\"]) { var price = data[\"tickers\"][0][\"converted_last\"][\"usd\"]; document.getElementById(\"bn_sb_input\").value = Math.round(price*100)/100; sb_calculate(); } }); } function sb_ajax(url, json) { var ajaxPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){ var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); var status = true; xhr.open('GET', url); xhr.send(); xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){ // check state of call if (xhr.readyState === 4){ // check if call was successful if (xhr.status === 200){ if (json) { var response = JSON.parse(this.responseText); // return data from callback resolve(response); } else { var response = this.responseText; // return data from callback resolve(response); } } else { // return error return console.log(\"failed request\"); } } else { if (status) { console.log(\"fetching...\"); status = false; } } } }); return ajaxPromise; } document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function() { sb_getPrice(); }); Superblock Voting Deadline \u00b6 Voting for proposals ends 60 blocks prior the Superblock.

Voting on proposals is important for the decentralized governance model to function properly. Voting Requirements & Important Information 5000 BLOCK is required in order to vote. The process of voting can take place from a wallet containing at least 5000 BLOCK, or a Service Node collateral wallet. An active Service Node is not required. Voting for proposals ends 60 blocks prior the Superblock. It'd be safer to make sure you vote no later than 61 blocks before the Superblock to make sure your voting transaction gets at least 1 confirmation. See next voting deadline here . The inputs (UTXOs) used for the 5000 BLOCK (to vote) must be 100 BLOCK or larger. The inputs used for the 5000 BLOCK must be in the same address. Since the votes are recorded on-chain, casting a vote requires you to pay a network fee. This requires each address to have an input separate from the inputs used for the 5000 BLOCK to pay for the network fees. This input used for the fee cannot be immature . Funds will remain immature for about 60 minutes (60 blocks) after they staked. If you are staking, your vote will automatically re-cast. Your vote is not counted until the voting transaction fee has 1 confirmation (typically 1 minute), after which your votes will be accounted for when viewing the listproposals command. If you vote again you will have to pay another network fee to do so. The voting system will automatically calculate how many votes you have available according to your balance (1 vote per 5000 BLOCK) and cast your full vote weight when voting (5562 BLOCK balance = 1 vote, 49635 BLOCK balance = 9 votes. The deadline for creating proposals is 2880 blocks prior to the Superblock. See next proposal submission deadline here . Examples Of Valid Input Setups Counts as 1 single vote: Address A Inputs: 2500, 2500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 5000 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 1 single vote: Address A Inputs: 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 5000 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 1 single vote wth excess (inefficient): Address A Inputs: 3000, 2500, 2500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 8000 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 3000 + 1 (tx fee input) Total: 3000 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 1 vote (inefficient): Address A Inputs: 2000, 2000, 1000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 5000 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 3000, 2000 Total: 5000 (no tx fee input) Counts as 2 votes: Address A Inputs: 3000, 3000, 3000, 1000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 10000 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 3 votes with excess (inefficient): Address A Inputs: 5000, 3000, 2000, 2000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 12000 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 3000, 3000, 2000, 1000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 9000 + 1 (tx fee input) Examples Of Invalid Input Setups Not at least 5000 BLOCK: Address A Inputs: 2500, 2000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 4500 + 1 (tx fee input) Not enought to cover fee: Address A Inputs: 2500, 2500 Total: 5000 Fee is not a separate input: Address A Inputs: 2500, 2501 Total: 5001 5000 BLOCK not in a single address: Address A Inputs: 4000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 4000 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 3000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 3000 + 1 (tx fee input) Proposals should be carefully reviewed along with the amount requested. It's a good idea to consider the total Superblock budget (40,000 BLOCK), the other proposals amounts requested, the priorities of the project, and if the proposal aligns with those priorities and greater vision of the project. The link for each proposal should lead to a description of what the proposal is for with background information and objectives. See how to view proposals . Voting from the Qt Wallet \u00b6 .md-typeset table:not([class]) td:not([align]) { text-align: center; } .md-typeset table:not([class]) td:not([align]):first-child { text-align: left; } There are two Qt wallets, with the Redesign geared towards being more user friendly. Below is a comparison between the Classic and Redesign Qt wallets. Qt Version Redesign (GUI) Redesign (console) Classic (console) Doesn't require console Lists proposals Shows descriptions (has link) (has link) (has link) Shows vote counts Shows pass/fail status Shows amounts requested Shows deposit addresses Shows past proposals Easy to navigate Simple voting UI Vote using the redesigned wallet Open the wallet and in the side menu, go to Proposals . The wallet needs to be unlocked to cast votes. The Proposals screen shows all the proposals submitted to the network. Above the list of proposals there is an option to filter by Upcoming , which displays the proposals that can currently be voted on. Select this filter to view all proposals currently open for voting. Review the proposals and the amount requested. It's a good idea to consider the total Superblock budget, the other proposals amounts requested, the priorities of the project, and if the proposal aligns with those priorities and greater vision of the project. The link for each proposal should lead to a description of what the proposal is for with some background information and objectives. The voting system will automatically calculate how many votes you have available according to your balance (1 vote per 5000 BLOCK) and cast your full vote weight when voting (5562 BLOCK balance = 1 vote, 49635 BLOCK balance = 9 votes. When ready to vote on a proposal, select the Vote button. A popup will appear that will be used to vote from. Select whether you'd like to approve the proposal ( Yes ) or vote against the proposal ( No ). After you have selected how you wish to vote, select the Vote button. This registers your vote to the network after the vote transaction has 1 confirmation (about 1 minute). Once you have voted you can change your vote by selecting the Change Vote button and selecting you new vote. Voting Complete! Repeat this process for every proposal you are voting for. Your vote is not counted until the voting transaction fee has 1 confirmation (typically 1 minute), after which your votes will be accounted for. If you spend any of your 5000 BLOCK inputs after you vote, the vote is marked invalid and you will need to cast your vote(s) again. If you are staking, your vote will automatically re-cast. Vote using the classic wallet Open the wallet . The wallet needs to be unlocked to cast votes. In the program menu, go to Window > Console . The debug console will open in a new window. In the input field at the bottom, type in listproposals , then press the Enter key. To view proposals since a specific block, use listproposals [BLOCK_NUMBER] instead. Example: listproposals 1209600 A message showing all proposals will be returned. Review the proposals and the amount requested. It's a good idea to consider the total Superblock budget, the other proposals amounts requested, the priorities of the project, and if the proposal aligns with those priorities and greater vision of the project. The link for each proposal should lead to a description of what the proposal is for with some background information and objectives. The proposal hash, which is a unique identifier for the proposal, can be found in each proposal\u2019s details. The voting command uses the following command structure: vote [PROPOSAL_HASH] [VOTE] PROPOSAL_HASH : The hash of the proposal you are voting for VOTE : Your vote (\u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019). yes means you'd like to vote to fund the proposal and no means you'd like to vote against the proposal so it isn't funded. The voting system will automatically calculate how many votes you have available according to your balance (1 vote per 5000 BLOCK) and cast your full vote weight when voting (5562 BLOCK balance = 1 vote, 49635 BLOCK balance = 9 votes. To vote, type the above command with [PROPOSAL_HASH] and [VOTE] replaced with the respective variables in place. Below is an example: vote 06a50c125aa305fbe38fa0fe9a1b39db1b1318838aadaec55f95c7a52101d83f yes Press the Enter key to submit the command and register your vote to the network. Voting Complete! Repeat this process for every proposal you are voting for. Your vote is not counted until the voting transaction fee has 1 confirmation (typically 1 minute), after which your votes will be accounted for. If you spend any of your 5000 BLOCK inputs after you vote, the vote is marked invalid and you will need to cast your vote(s) again. If you are staking, your vote will automatically re-cast. Voting from the Terminal \u00b6 Linux Start the wallet . If it's not already running, use the following instructions to start it. Navigate to the bin folder within your Blocknet wallet installation directory (EG: ~/blocknet/bin/ ) Type in the following command, replacing [USERNAME] and [PASSWORD] with the respective rpcuser= and rpcpassword= values from your blocknet.conf file located in your ~/.blocknet/ directory. . / blocknetd - rpcuser =[ USERNAME ] - rpcpassword =[ PASSWORD ] - daemon Example: ./blocknetd -rpcuser=JohnBlocknet -rpcpassword=supersecretpassword -daemon The wallet process will begin in the current terminal window. You will need to open a new terminal window or tab and navigate to the same location before continuing. If your wallet was just started, you may need to wait a few minutes for the proposals to sync, otherwise you may not see the full list of proposals. Use the following command to view the proposals: ./blocknet-cli listproposals To view proposals since a specific block: . / blocknet - cli listproposals [ BLOCK_NUMBER ] Example: ./blocknet-cli listproposals 1209600 Review the proposals and the amount requested.

Voting on proposals is important for the decentralized governance model to function properly. Voting Requirements & Important Information 5000 BLOCK is required in order to vote. The process of voting can take place from a wallet containing at least 5000 BLOCK, or a Service Node collateral wallet. An active Service Node is not required. Voting for proposals ends 60 blocks prior the Superblock. It'd be safer to make sure you vote no later than 61 blocks before the Superblock to make sure your voting transaction gets at least 1 confirmation. See next voting deadline here . The inputs (UTXOs) used for the 5000 BLOCK (to vote) must be 100 BLOCK or larger. The inputs used for the 5000 BLOCK must be in the same address. Since the votes are recorded on-chain, casting a vote requires you to pay a network fee. This requires each address to have an input separate from the inputs used for the 5000 BLOCK to pay for the network fees. This input used for the fee cannot be immature . Funds will remain immature for about 60 minutes (60 blocks) after they staked. If you are staking, your vote will automatically re-cast. Your vote is not counted until the voting transaction fee has 1 confirmation (typically 1 minute), after which your votes will be accounted for when viewing the listproposals command. If you vote again you will have to pay another network fee to do so. The voting system will automatically calculate how many votes you have available according to your balance (1 vote per 5000 BLOCK) and cast your full vote weight when voting (5562 BLOCK balance = 1 vote, 49635 BLOCK balance = 9 votes. The deadline for creating proposals is 2880 blocks prior to the Superblock. See next proposal submission deadline here . Examples Of Valid Input Setups Counts as 1 single vote: Address A Inputs: 2500, 2500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 5000 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 1 single vote: Address A Inputs: 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 5000 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 1 single vote wth excess (inefficient): Address A Inputs: 3000, 2500, 2500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 8000 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 3000 + 1 (tx fee input) Total: 3000 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 1 vote (inefficient): Address A Inputs: 2000, 2000, 1000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 5000 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 3000, 2000 Total: 5000 (no tx fee input) Counts as 2 votes: Address A Inputs: 3000, 3000, 3000, 1000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 10000 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 3 votes with excess (inefficient): Address A Inputs: 5000, 3000, 2000, 2000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 12000 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 3000, 3000, 2000, 1000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 9000 + 1 (tx fee input) Examples Of Invalid Input Setups Not at least 5000 BLOCK: Address A Inputs: 2500, 2000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 4500 + 1 (tx fee input) Not enought to cover fee: Address A Inputs: 2500, 2500 Total: 5000 Fee is not a separate input: Address A Inputs: 2500, 2501 Total: 5001 5000 BLOCK not in a single address: Address A Inputs: 4000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 4000 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 3000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 3000 + 1 (tx fee input) Proposals should be carefully reviewed along with the amount requested. It's a good idea to consider the total Superblock budget (40,000 BLOCK), the other proposals amounts requested, the priorities of the project, and if the proposal aligns with those priorities and greater vision of the project.

The ability to view proposals is important for the decentralized governance model to function properly, enabling informed discussions and voting . Voting Requirements & Important Information 5000 BLOCK is required in order to vote. The process of voting can take place from a wallet containing at least 5000 BLOCK, or a Service Node collateral wallet. An active Service Node is not required. Additional important information: The UTXO inputs used for the 5000 BLOCK (to vote) must be 100 BLOCK or larger. If you spend or stake any of your 5000 BLOCK inputs after you vote, the vote is marked invalid and you will need to cast your vote(s) again (an auto-revote mechanism will be created). Since the votes are recorded on-chain, casting a vote requires you to pay a network fee. It is best practice to have a small UTXO input for each vote to pay for the network fees. Your vote is not counted until the voting transaction fee has 1 confirmation (typically 1 minute), after which your votes will be accounted for when viewing the listproposals command. If you vote again you will have to pay another network fee to do so. The voting system will automatically calculate how many votes you have available according to your balance (1 vote per 5000 BLOCK) and cast your full vote weight when voting (5562 BLOCK balance = 1 vote, 49635 BLOCK balance = 9 votes. At least 60 minutes must pass before you can change your vote(s). The deadline for creating proposals is 2880 blocks prior to the Superblock. Voting for proposals ends 60 blocks prior the Superblock. Proposals should be carefully reviewed along with the amount requested. It's a good idea to consider the total Superblock budget (40,000 BLOCK), the other proposals amounts requested, the priorities of the project, and if the proposal aligns with those priorities and greater vision of the project. The link for each proposal should lead to a description of what the proposal is for with background information and objectives.","title":"View Proposals"},{"location":"governance/view-proposals/#viewing-from-the-qt-wallet","text":".md-typeset table:not([class]) td:not([align]) { text-align: center; } .md-typeset table:not([class]) td:not([align]):first-child { text-align: left; } There are two Qt wallets, with the Redesign geared towards being more user friendly.

This exponentially increases the development capabilities and enables a new generation of mature blockchains and services. Blocknet is an open sourced, self-funded, and self-governed project with contributors around the world building an open and collaborative ecosystem. Subscribe to the following email lists for the latest features, updates, and news! General Newsletter Service Node Newsletter Developer Newsletter Background \u00b6 Started in 2014, Blocknet is a decentralized, community-governed , self-funded , open-sourced project that serves as a connector between different blockchains, markets, and communities. The project was founded on the principles of openness, transparency, and maintaining a high level of decentralization. These principles apply to both our community and protocol, which are aimed to bring blockchains and communities together. Blocknet is unique in that there is no company or foundation behind the project. Instead, Blocknet is self-governed by its stakeholders, meaning that stakers, token-holders, Service Node operators and others with a stake in the blockchain have the ability to make decisions together. This self-governance is maintained through a Superblock mechanism, as well as open communication in our Discord . The project is also open-source, meaning anybody can contribute. From development, to content creation, to tools and services, we welcome all and encourage you to take part! You have the freedom to lead up your own project, collaborate with others at your own pace, or come and go as you please. We\u2019re also always working to develop and improve our collaboration process, so if there\u2019s any suggestions on ways to better the process we\u2019d love to hear it! At Blocknet, we take pride in the level of decentralization the project and protocol maintains. We invite you to join us in our vision of a collaborative blockchain ecosystem. Vision \u00b6 The future Blocknet sees for blockchain is a highly collaborative microservice ecosystem. At the moment, there are many projects that try to provide as many features as possible in a single blockchain, resulting in the finished product being inefficient and bloated. This is called monolithic architecture and is generally considered poor practice in software development. We envision an ecosystem of single-purpose microservice blockchains that perform one task really well and are secure, reliable, and efficient. These microservice blockchains can then be consumed by dApps and other blockchains to build more complex, yet modular, services. This type of architecture is made possible with the Blocknet Protocol. Just as the internet enabled computers to communicate, the Blocknet Protocol enables an internet of blockchains, which is critical for the ecosystem to realize its full potential. Aside from the use-cases listed here , let\u2019s take a look at 2 more specific examples of what the Blocknet Protocol enables: Development If developing a dApp, in the current state of the ecosystem a developer must choose between either developing on an existing platform such as Ethereum, forking a project with similar traits, or building a blockchain from scratch. However, with the use of the Blocknet Protocol, it makes development blockchain-agnostic. This means development can occur on any chain and the features needed can be pulled in from other blockchains. For instance, if building a dApp on Ethereum and needed a storage solution, the dApp will be able to use the protocol to communicate with Siacoin or Storj or any other storage blockchain to consume their services. If the dApp needed to perform heavy computations, Golem or Sonm could be used. If the dApp had a payment aspect, payments can be made in Bitcoin or Litecoin, which are more widely supported by vendors. The protocol enables the use of services from other chains similar to the way libraries are used in traditional software development, allowing developers to focus on the business logic of the application. This technology helps future proof development and also helps monetize blockchain services as features on blockchains are consumed. Supply Chain In supply chain, there will be multiple blockchains being used at various steps of the process much like there is today with traditional software stacks. The Blocknet Protocol would allow information to be accessible between these different blockchains. For instance, pharmaceutical manufacturers have strict regulations to follow and need to provide certain information and assurances. Being able to access lot information from the raw materials being consumed, temperature and humidity information during transportation, and final destinations are all important. The Blocknet Protocol would enable this communication to occur in a trustless matter, which is important to ensure validity of the information. Project History \u00b6 Blocknet was created on October 20th, 2014. A week later, from October 29th, 2014 until November 5th, 2014 an initial trade offering was held on Bittrex . In the initial trade offering, 3,876,915.43 BLOCK was sold at a price of 0.00025 BTC per BLOCK. There was 369 BTC sold plus altcoins, for a combined total of 969 BTC worth. The price of BTC on November 5th, 2014 was around $335, bringing the total value to $325,000. The founding team then set out to conduct research on how to best conduct atomic swaps and develop an interoperability protocol that is not only decentralized, but also trustless.

The project was founded on the principles of openness, transparency, and maintaining a high level of decentralization. These principles apply to both our community and protocol, which are aimed to bring blockchains and communities together. Blocknet is unique in that there is no company or foundation behind the project. Instead, Blocknet is self-governed by its stakeholders, meaning that stakers, token-holders, Service Node operators and others with a stake in the blockchain have the ability to make decisions together. This self-governance is maintained through a Superblock mechanism, as well as open communication in our Discord . The project is also open-source, meaning anybody can contribute. From development, to content creation, to tools and services, we welcome all and encourage you to take part! You have the freedom to lead up your own project, collaborate with others at your own pace, or come and go as you please. We\u2019re also always working to develop and improve our collaboration process, so if there\u2019s any suggestions on ways to better the process we\u2019d love to hear it! At Blocknet, we take pride in the level of decentralization the project and protocol maintains. We invite you to join us in our vision of a collaborative blockchain ecosystem.","title":"Background"},{"location":"project/introduction/#vision","text":"The future Blocknet sees for blockchain is a highly collaborative microservice ecosystem. At the moment, there are many projects that try to provide as many features as possible in a single blockchain, resulting in the finished product being inefficient and bloated. This is called monolithic architecture and is generally considered poor practice in software development. We envision an ecosystem of single-purpose microservice blockchains that perform one task really well and are secure, reliable, and efficient. These microservice blockchains can then be consumed by dApps and other blockchains to build more complex, yet modular, services. This type of architecture is made possible with the Blocknet Protocol. Just as the internet enabled computers to communicate, the Blocknet Protocol enables an internet of blockchains, which is critical for the ecosystem to realize its full potential. Aside from the use-cases listed here , let\u2019s take a look at 2 more specific examples of what the Blocknet Protocol enables: Development If developing a dApp, in the current state of the ecosystem a developer must choose between either developing on an existing platform such as Ethereum, forking a project with similar traits, or building a blockchain from scratch. However, with the use of the Blocknet Protocol, it makes development blockchain-agnostic. This means development can occur on any chain and the features needed can be pulled in from other blockchains. For instance, if building a dApp on Ethereum and needed a storage solution, the dApp will be able to use the protocol to communicate with Siacoin or Storj or any other storage blockchain to consume their services. If the dApp needed to perform heavy computations, Golem or Sonm could be used. If the dApp had a payment aspect, payments can be made in Bitcoin or Litecoin, which are more widely supported by vendors.

All existing holdings, fees, rewards, and collaterals will be increased proportionally. This change is needed to preemptively address an anticipated technical problem regarding microfees and dust amounts. Note: If you own BLOCK, your own balance will multiply by 100. This seems to be a common misconception. All values will be multiplied by 100. It's effectively similar to moving the decimal point 2 digits to the right. Issue \u00b6 Currently there's a limit to how small of a transaction you can spend due to something called dust values. When sending really small amounts the network transaction fee also accounts for a larger percent of the total amount sent. These two things pose an issue for XRouter, where it's important to support really small micro fees for services. As the dollar ($USD) value of BLOCK increases, so does the limit for how small of a dollar ($USD) value you can send. This means that even at the smallest available amount to send, XRouter transactions can become expensive which isn't good as you want to be able to support those micro fees. Rather than waiting until this issue comes to a head resulting in an emergency hard fork, we would like to get ahead of the problem. Comments from 86B on Discord regarding dust amounts Lets say we moved the relay fee out to match BTCs at 0.00001. Using the 2000bytes example, sending a $0.005 (half cent) microfee would be charged $0.02 by the network for a 366% charge. Now lets assume we make XRouter transactions feeless.

When sending really small amounts the network transaction fee also accounts for a larger percent of the total amount sent. These two things pose an issue for XRouter, where it's important to support really small micro fees for services. As the dollar ($USD) value of BLOCK increases, so does the limit for how small of a dollar ($USD) value you can send. This means that even at the smallest available amount to send, XRouter transactions can become expensive which isn't good as you want to be able to support those micro fees. Rather than waiting until this issue comes to a head resulting in an emergency hard fork, we would like to get ahead of the problem. Comments from 86B on Discord regarding dust amounts Lets say we moved the relay fee out to match BTCs at 0.00001. Using the 2000bytes example, sending a $0.005 (half cent) microfee would be charged $0.02 by the network for a 366% charge. Now lets assume we make XRouter transactions feeless.

This proposal is for use of the Burn Fund ( BpzPFJaaKQVSvfiH7zXSUdPBrBnfx9v26V ) and to increase the Superblock from 4,320 BLOCK to 40,000 BLOCK. Please continue reading to understand the reasoning and the need for this. To better understand the financial state of the project, a more comprehensive tracking sheet has been created after feedback from the community, which can be seen here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xFm5LJsRNN62-9XZFqfDckUt2x8ps3pUOBISUxNQYpc/ In this financial sheet, you can see the remaining funds (Balance Summary), a breakdown of expenses (Expense Summary), the relation of expenses to price of BLOCK (Expense Charts), and projected expenses moving forward (Projected Expenses). This sheet will be referenced throughout the proposal. Current Expenses \u00b6 Many expenses and functions within this project have been cut in response to the market decline and subsequently the value of BLOCK (Expense Charts, Total Expenses vs BLOCK Price). The project has had to make many sacrifices by making cuts to developers, the office, marketing initiatives, other contributors, and cuts in pay to remaining contributors (Projected Expenses, E3:F22). Current expenses for next month (Projected Expenses, A3:C24) are down to the absolute minimum to support core functions, with a projected estimated monthly expense of $35,400 + 1,045 BLOCK (mixed denominations because some request amounts in BLOCK). At the current price of $1.75 BLOCK, a total of 21,274 BLOCK is needed to support the project. If the market falls further, at $1.00 BLOCK the project would need 36,445 BLOCK to sustain itself. Funding Remaining \u00b6 The project currently has 15,618 BLOCK remaining (Balance Summary, D12), which includes a maximum of 4,320 from the Superblock. At the current burn rate of the project, the remaining funds will not be able to support the core functions of this project and will be depleted this month. After that point, the project will be solely dependent on the the Superblock, which is not sufficient to support even 1 full time developer. Solution \u00b6 The proposed solution for overcoming the current financial situation comes in 2 parts: Increasing the Superblock to give a stronger guarantee of covering our operational expenses. Using the Burn Fund to provide us with a safety net against the future potential (downwards) movement of the market. No amount of cutting expenses changes the fact that the Superblock can't cover the project's operating costs, even when restricted to core functions. The price of BLOCK would need to be $11 (6x increase) for it to sustain just the bare minimum of operations. Increasing the Superblock to 40,000 BLOCK will not only guarantee funding if the price of BLOCK drops to $1, but as the price of BLOCK increases, it would provide the project enough funds to do the following: Compete with the larger, well-funded players in the market. At the moment every contributor has their hands full with tasks. An increased budget will allow for more contributors, allowing us to more evenly distribute tasks, expand the team and move more rapidly as a project. As an example of what we're competing against as a project, Komodo (KMD) has 10 Administration and Support staff, 8 Marketing, and Business Development staff. Attract investors with additional large exchange listings. As the market picks up and the price of BLOCK recovers, there will be funds available for market makers and the opportunity to get listed on larger exchanges, which will create a healthier market for BLOCK, making the project more attractive to investors. Attract partners and integrators. Additional funds will provide the ability to host/sponsor hackathons, create an incubator program where integrators can apply for funding to start developing software that utilizes the Blocknet Protocol, and entice potential partners. Attract and retain developers. In addition to hackathons, which would help attract developers, having the funds to pay developers for contributing to the project is also a necessity to build the technical contributor base. Please note that not all of the Superblock needs to be utilized. At the same time, this increase provides potential future opportunity for the project to grow and expand. In addition to an increased Superblock, we are proposing use of the Burn Funds. The Burn Fund currently contains \u2248127k BLOCK, is already unlocked and in the team\u2019s control, and is accounted for in the circulation. The proposed distribution is as follows: Ecosystem Growth Fund - 10k BLOCK Marketing Fund - 10k BLOCK Business Development Fund - 7k BLOCK Development Fund - 100k BLOCK The point of having both the Superblock and using the Burn Fund is two-fold. The update to increase the Superblock will take 2-3 months to coordinate with exchanges to prevent forking so the Burn Fund will provide funding in the interim. Without the increased Superblock and just using the Burn Funds, the project will only have a runway of 8 months at the current BLOCK price. Having both the Superblock and the Burn Fund is also beneficial to secure Blocknet's funding into the future. With increasing the Superblock to a point where it can sustain the project, more proposals for expenses can be voted on by Service Nodes and the Community Funds would remain as a true \u2018reserve fund\u2019 (as was originally intended). This is the most ideal scenario to make sure the project remains financially stable. Liquidation \u00b6 Some may be concerned about liquidation when increasing the Superblock. This should not be a concern as the market has been absorbing the Superblock and additional expenses just fine. However, we will also be opting to selling funds on the DX when possible as opposed to CEXs and are in contact with a handful of community members that are interested in OTC to help take unneeded sell pressure off the market. Conclusion \u00b6 This project is in a dire financial situation and it's not even operating at the capacity it should be. These measures will not only secure Blocknet's funding, but also provide strong future growth to allow maturation as a project and product(s) that are fully capable of competing with the rest of the market. // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

This means that out of every block reward, instead of having 70% (0.7 BLOCK) going to Service Nodes and 30% (0.3 BLOCK) going stakers, both Service Nodes and stakers would be combined into the same pool for 100% of the block reward. There's 3 technical reasons for this proposal: The Service Node list for block rewards is too fragile to maintain and causes forks in the network due to the structure of the block reward payouts. The single tier block reward system remove need for this list in this context and the issues associated with it. The current difference in staking and Service Node rewards incentivizes Service Node operators to switch to staking, which causes fluctuations in Service Node support. This change increases the amount of stakers on the network, therefore increasing the security of the blockchain. The ROI of stakers and Service Nodes should be barely affected over time as the constant rebalancing of BLOCK from Service Nodes to staking naturally brings the ROI of the Service Nodes and stakers to an equilibrium. The ROI of an equilibrium state in the double tier block reward system we have now is equal to the ROI of the single tier block reward system as can be seen below. In this single tier block reward system: Everyone can stake, even Service Nodes. The total block reward will continue to be 1 BLOCK. There will only be one block reward winner, either a typical staker or a Service Node, and they receive the entire 1 BLOCK reward. Winning a block reward will remain probabilistic based off the amount you're staking vs the amount staked on the network. A 5k BLOCK input will still be required to run a Service Node. A 5k input will still be required to vote.

There's 3 technical reasons for this proposal: The Service Node list for block rewards is too fragile to maintain and causes forks in the network due to the structure of the block reward payouts. The single tier block reward system remove need for this list in this context and the issues associated with it. The current difference in staking and Service Node rewards incentivizes Service Node operators to switch to staking, which causes fluctuations in Service Node support. This change increases the amount of stakers on the network, therefore increasing the security of the blockchain. The ROI of stakers and Service Nodes should be barely affected over time as the constant rebalancing of BLOCK from Service Nodes to staking naturally brings the ROI of the Service Nodes and stakers to an equilibrium. The ROI of an equilibrium state in the double tier block reward system we have now is equal to the ROI of the single tier block reward system as can be seen below. In this single tier block reward system: Everyone can stake, even Service Nodes. The total block reward will continue to be 1 BLOCK. There will only be one block reward winner, either a typical staker or a Service Node, and they receive the entire 1 BLOCK reward. Winning a block reward will remain probabilistic based off the amount you're staking vs the amount staked on the network. A 5k BLOCK input will still be required to run a Service Node. A 5k input will still be required to vote.","title":"Proposal"},{"location":"proposals/single-tier-block-reward/#calculations","text":"// read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = [];","title":"Calculations"},{"location":"proposals/single-tier-block-reward/#related-links","text":"var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

As a result, most digital assets in existence today are compatible. Currently Blocknet has over 100 digital assets tested and confirmed to be supported by XBridge, with the number continuously growing as more are integrated. Integration \u00b6 Being integrated with Blocknet holds many benefits. Not only does it allow an asset to be traded using Block DX, a decentralized exchange built on XBridge, but it allows other services to be built utilizing the asset. This extends the demand, utility, and accessibility of the asset to the rest of the ecosystem. Integration of assets is a free and open process, without permission required. All configuration files are located in Blocknet's blockchain-configuration-files Github repository. If you would like to have a digital asset supported, please ask a member of that project to fill out the integration form or create a pull request. Blockchain Requirements \u00b6 In order for for a blockchain to be compatible it must support JSON RPC, CLTV atomic swaps, and the following calls: createrawtransaction decoderawtransaction getblock getblockchaininfo (fallback getnetworkinfo, getinfo) getblockhash getnewaddress getrawmempool getrawtransaction gettransaction gettxout listunspent sendrawtransaction signmessage signrawtransaction (or signrawtransactionwithwallet) verifymessage Supported Digital Assets \u00b6 Note : XBridge is not yet compatible with hardware wallets such as Ledger, web wallets such as MyEtherWallet (MEW), or lite wallets such as Jaxx.

Maker Fee \u00b6 When creating an order with XBridge, there is no fee other than the transaction fee for the network of the token being sold. This is the same type of fee you would incur if sending this token to another party. Having no fee to place an order encourages market makers to add liquidity. This also makes it possible to acquire the BLOCK needed to take orders. Taker Fee \u00b6 When accepting an order with XBridge, a static fee of 0.015 BLOCK is charged at the time the order is taken. This fee is charged even if a trade is canceled or fails and is meant to discourage malicious behavior on the network. In addition to the 0.015 BLOCK fee, there is also the transaction fee for the network of the token being sold. This is the same type of fee you would incur if sending this token to another party. If the taker asset is BLOCK, there needs to be at least two UTXOs - one or more to cover the 0.015 BLOCK fee and one or more to cover the traded amount. In a future update, there will be a percent-based fee that\u2019s charged when accepting an order, but the details of this are not yet finalized. Fees Distribution \u00b6 100% of trade fees are distributed to Service Node operators for supporting the network. // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

If you have not yet setup the Blocknet wallet, start with the Wallet Setup Guide . XBridge is a decentralized exchange protocol with the ability to perform non-custodial, trustless, and decentralized exchange between any digital assets that is supported by the Blocknet Protocol. XBridge allows any application to perform decentralized exchange, opening the door to an ecosystem of decentralized trading services. For each market you would like to trade on, you must run the full nodes of those blockchains in addition to the Blocknet wallet. For example, if you are trading on the BTC-LTC market, you must have the Blocknet, Litecoin, and Bitcoin wallets fully synced and running locally. Note: Full nodes are required. Lite wallets and Electrum wallets are not supported. You must run full blockchain nodes with txindex=1 . In order to check if you are running a full node, use the getblockchaininfo command. You should see \"pruned\": false, if you are running a full node. If you see \"pruned\": true, then make sure txindex=1 is in that wallet's configureation file and restart the wallet. See the list of compatible blockchains . A third party is working on implementing a lite multiwallet solution based off XRouter, but this has not been released yet. To setup XBridge, follow these steps: Configure Wallet Confs Configure XBridge Conf Next Steps To configure XBridge, Blocknet's xbridge.conf file and the wallet configuration files for each supported blockchain must be setup properly. Configuration is specific to the blockchain and wallet version. Here is a list of compatible blockchains and wallet versions . All configuration files can be found in the blockchain-configuration-files Github repo . Blocknet uses a manifest ( view manifest ) to determine which configurations to use based off the blockchain and wallet version. The manifest uses a code-friendly format called JSON. This manifest uses \"version groups\", which is a group of wallet versions for a blockchain that pertain to a specific set of configurations. A blockchain can have multiple version groups, each with different sets of wallet versions. Each version group is separated by {curly brackets} and contains similar sets of information. The information you will need to focus on is the following: Key Example Data (Bitcoin) Description blockchain Bitcoin The name of the blockchain. ticker BTC The blockchain's ticker. ver_name Bitcoin v0.16.x Version group name. versions [\"v0.16.0\",\"v0.16.1\",\"v0.16.2\",\"v0.16.3\"] The wallet versions compatible with this version group. xbridge_conf bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf Filename of XBridge configs for these wallet version. wallet_conf bitcoin--v0.16.0.conf Filename of wallet config for these wallet versions. Configure Wallet Confs \u00b6 In the manifest , find the version group for the blockchain you want to trade. For example, if you want to trade Bitcoin and have wallet version 0.17.0.1 then find the version group that says \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\" and has \"v0.17.0.1\" listed under \"versions\" . There are multiple version groups for Bitcoin, but only 1 version group with v0.17.0.1 listed under it: { \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\", \"ticker\": \"BTC\", \"ver_id\": \"bitcoin--v0.17.0\", \"ver_name\": \"Bitcoin v0.17.x\", \"conf_name\": \"bitcoin.conf\", \"dir_name_linux\": \"bitcoin\", \"dir_name_mac\": \"Bitcoin\", \"dir_name_win\": \"Bitcoin\", \"repo_url\": \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\", \"versions\": [ \"v0.17.0\", \"v0.17.0.1\", \"v0.17.1\" ], \"xbridge_conf\": \"bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf\", \"wallet_conf\": \"bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf\" }, Take a note of the \"wallet_conf\" filename. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1 it is bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf . Navigate to the wallet-confs/ folder of the blockchain configuration files repo: https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/tree/master/wallet-confs Open the file with the filename listed in the version group. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1, filename bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf , that would be this file: https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/wallet-confs/bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf Copy that file's contents. These are the contents of bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf : server=1 listen=1 rpcuser= rpcpassword= rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 port=8333 rpcport=8332 txindex=1 # Legacy addresses must be used (address must begin with \"1\", not \"3\") addresstype=legacy changetype=legacy # Enable deprecated calls deprecatedrpc=signrawtransaction Open the wallet's configuration file. For Bitcoin this is bitcoin.conf . Delete any contents in this file. This is important because and duplicate settings can mess with the configuration. Paste the previously copied file contents into the wallet's configuration file. Enter a username and password for rpcuser= and rpcpassword= . These should be difficult and secure credentials. Enter the IP of your Blocknet client for rpcallowip= . If this blockchain will be hosted on the same computer as the Blocknet client, use rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 (localhost). Save the configuration file. If the blockchain's wallet has been open, you will ned to restart it to load the updated configurations. Repeat this process for each blockchain you want to trade. There's an additional dxnowallets= setting unique to the blocknet.conf . If set to 1 , you will aggregate orders for all markets, not just for your connected assets. This is useful for view-only and browsing purposes. You will still need the wallets connected for any market you want to trade on. If a dxnowallets= setting is specified, it will override the ShowAllOrders= setting in your xbridge.conf header. XBridge Conf \u00b6 In the manifest , find the version group for the blockchain you want to trade. For example, if you want to trade Bitcoin and have wallet version 0.17.0.1 then find the version group that says \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\" and has \"v0.17.0.1\" listed under \"versions\" . Thre are multiple version groups for Bitcoin, but only 1 version group with v0.17.0.1 listed under it: { \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\", \"ticker\": \"BTC\", \"ver_id\": \"bitcoin--v0.17.0\", \"ver_name\": \"Bitcoin v0.17.x\", \"conf_name\": \"bitcoin.conf\", \"dir_name_linux\": \"bitcoin\", \"dir_name_mac\": \"Bitcoin\", \"dir_name_win\": \"Bitcoin\", \"repo_url\": \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\", \"versions\": [ \"v0.17.0\", \"v0.17.0.1\", \"v0.17.1\" ], \"xbridge_conf\": \"bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf\", \"wallet_conf\": \"bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf\" }, Take a note of the \"xbridge_conf\" filename.

Repeat this process and paste in the XBridge configurations for other blockchains. Update each blockchain's Username= , Password= , and Ip= setting with the rpcuser= , rpcpassword= , and rpcallowip= values from the respective wallet conf file. The Address= setting can be left blank. Update Confirmations= to how many confirmations you would for the asset the counterparty is trading. There are many security protections and precautions already in place, but this is recommended to be set to at least 1 for congested networks and networks with highly fluctuating fees to make sure transactions aren't kicked out of the mempool. This is already set to Confirmations=1 by default for any networks that are deemed to meet this criteria. The ShowAllOrders= is optional. If set to true , you will aggregate orders for all markets, not just for your connected assets. This is useful for view-only and browsing purposes. You will still need the wallets connected for any market you want to trade on. If a dxnowallets= setting is specified in your blocknet.conf file it will override this ShowAllOrders= setting.

If you have not yet setup the Blocknet wallet, start with the Wallet Setup Guide . XBridge is a decentralized exchange protocol with the ability to perform non-custodial, trustless, and decentralized exchange between any digital assets that is supported by the Blocknet Protocol. XBridge allows any application to perform decentralized exchange, opening the door to an ecosystem of decentralized trading services. For each market you would like to trade on, you must run the full nodes of those blockchains in addition to the Blocknet wallet. For example, if you are trading on the BTC-LTC market, you must have the Blocknet, Litecoin, and Bitcoin wallets fully synced and running locally. Note: Full nodes are required. Lite wallets and Electrum wallets are not supported. You must run full blockchain nodes with txindex=1 . In order to check if you are running a full node, use the getblockchaininfo command. You should see \"pruned\": false, if you are running a full node. If you see \"pruned\": true, then make sure txindex=1 is in that wallet's configureation file and restart the wallet. See the list of compatible blockchains . A third party is working on implementing a lite multiwallet solution based off XRouter, but this has not been released yet. To setup XBridge, follow these steps: Configure Wallet Confs Configure XBridge Conf Next Steps To configure XBridge, Blocknet's xbridge.conf file and the wallet configuration files for each supported blockchain must be setup properly. Configuration is specific to the blockchain and wallet version. Here is a list of compatible blockchains and wallet versions . All configuration files can be found in the blockchain-configuration-files Github repo . Blocknet uses a manifest ( view manifest ) to determine which configurations to use based off the blockchain and wallet version. The manifest uses a code-friendly format called JSON. This manifest uses \"version groups\", which is a group of wallet versions for a blockchain that pertain to a specific set of configurations. A blockchain can have multiple version groups, each with different sets of wallet versions. Each version group is separated by {curly brackets} and contains similar sets of information. The information you will need to focus on is the following: Key Example Data (Bitcoin) Description blockchain Bitcoin The name of the blockchain. ticker BTC The blockchain's ticker. ver_name Bitcoin v0.16.x Version group name. versions [\"v0.16.0\",\"v0.16.1\",\"v0.16.2\",\"v0.16.3\"] The wallet versions compatible with this version group. xbridge_conf bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf Filename of XBridge configs for these wallet version. wallet_conf bitcoin--v0.16.0.conf Filename of wallet config for these wallet versions.","title":"XBridge Setup Guide"},{"location":"protocol/xbridge/setup/#configure-wallet-confs","text":"In the manifest , find the version group for the blockchain you want to trade. For example, if you want to trade Bitcoin and have wallet version 0.17.0.1 then find the version group that says \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\" and has \"v0.17.0.1\" listed under \"versions\" . There are multiple version groups for Bitcoin, but only 1 version group with v0.17.0.1 listed under it: { \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\", \"ticker\": \"BTC\", \"ver_id\": \"bitcoin--v0.17.0\", \"ver_name\": \"Bitcoin v0.17.x\", \"conf_name\": \"bitcoin.conf\", \"dir_name_linux\": \"bitcoin\", \"dir_name_mac\": \"Bitcoin\", \"dir_name_win\": \"Bitcoin\", \"repo_url\": \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\", \"versions\": [ \"v0.17.0\", \"v0.17.0.1\", \"v0.17.1\" ], \"xbridge_conf\": \"bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf\", \"wallet_conf\": \"bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf\" }, Take a note of the \"wallet_conf\" filename.

Enter the IP of your Blocknet client for rpcallowip= . If this blockchain will be hosted on the same computer as the Blocknet client, use rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 (localhost). Save the configuration file. If the blockchain's wallet has been open, you will ned to restart it to load the updated configurations. Repeat this process for each blockchain you want to trade. There's an additional dxnowallets= setting unique to the blocknet.conf . If set to 1 , you will aggregate orders for all markets, not just for your connected assets.

Design \u00b6 The XRouter system utilizes the Service Node network to route calls from the client directly to the respective blockchain. There are 2 types of XRouter calls: submissions and queries. XRouter submissions are calls that involve interactions with a blockchain, such as xrSendTransaction . With submissions, the packets are routed from the client to the respective blockchain and a response, if any, is routed back to the client. XRouter queries are calls requesting information from a blockchain, such as xrGetBlockCount . With queries, the packets are also routed from the client to the respective blockchain and the response of the information queried is routed back to the client. XRouter queries can require a specific amount of Service Nodes to receive a response from in order to achieve consensus on the final answer. XRouter Overview (view full size image) The following diagrams depict the events of an XRouter query and submission. As seen in the diagrams, a \"client\" refers to software utilizing the Blocknet Protocol, which can be a blockchain, microservice, dApp, mobile app, website, etc. XRouter Query (view full size image) The flow of the diagram is top-to-bottom: The client dispatches a packet for a query via API call to the Service Node network. The Service Nodes supporting the queried blockchain receive the packet. The Service Nodes route the packet of the query to the blockchain. The Service Nodes route the response from the blockchain back to the client. The client receives all responses, as well as a response for a majority consensus on the answer. XRouter Submission (view full size image) The client dispatches a packet for a submission via API call to the Service Node network. The Service Nodes supporting the desired blockchain receive the packet. The Service Nodes route the packet of the query to the blockchain. If there is a response from the blockchain, the Service Nodes route the response back to the client. Namespace \u00b6 XRouter SPV wallets utlize the xr:: namespace while XCloud services utilize the xrs:: namespace. A list of the SPV wallets and services can be viewed using xrGetNetworkServices and you can pre-connect to the nodes with xrConnect . Node Scoring \u00b6 Clients keep a local score of each Service Node (network-wide repuation system is planned). When a Service Node reaches a score of -200 , the Service Node will be banned by the client for a 24hr period. After this 24hr period, the Service Node will start with a score of -25 . The ban score threshold can be adjusted using the xrouterbanscore setting in blocknet.conf (see setup ). This scoring used for both XRouter and XCloud . Action Change in Score Failure to respond to call within 30s -25 Failure to meet majority consensus -5 Matching consensus correct_nodes * 2 Sending bad XRouter config -10 Sending bad XCloud config -2 This mechanism and values are subject to change in future releases. Join the Developer mailing list to stay updated. Fees \u00b6 With XRouter, and subsequently XCloud , fees are determined by a free market. Service Nodes can specify the fee that they wish to charge for a call and client can specify the max fee they are willing to pay for calls. Note about IP sharing and Fees. When testing and enhancing XRouter, we encountered a bit of IP-sharing between snodes. This is bad practice, because it's evidently a case of one entity voting twice in an XRouter proof. As such go-xrouter filters out duplicate nodes per IP address, so the second node won't get any fees. Use Cases \u00b6 The applications for XRouter are as vast and imaginative as the internet. Below are a few examples of use cases: Supply Chain - In supply chain there will be multiple blockchains being used at various steps of the process much like there is today with traditional software stacks. The Blocknet Protocol and XRouter would allow information to be accessible between these different blockchains. For Example, pharmaceutical manufacturers have strict regulations to follow and need to provide certain information and assurances. Being able to access batch information from the raw materials being consumed, temperature and humidity information during transportation, and final destinations are all important. A smart contract utilizing XRouter to gather this information from each respective chain and write it to the pharmaceutical\u2019s blockchain along with the batch code. XRouter would enable this communication to occur in a trustless way, which is important to ensure validity of the information. Storage and Hosting - If creating a dApp on Ethereum, you may require storage functionality. Ethereum doesn\u2019t intrinsically handle file storage very efficiently. In this scenario, XRouter can be used to interact with other blockchains such as Storj, Filecoin, Sia, or Swarm to utilize their storage services. Media and Content - For content creation, a creator has the option of publishing to the LBRY Credits or Alexandria blockchains. Similar to HootSuite, which is a tool that allows posting to multiple social media platforms simultaneously, a dApp can be created using XRouter that offers the same benefit. The user can post their content once, whether it\u2019s audio, video, literature, or art, and have it published to Alexandria\u2019s and LBRY Credit\u2019s blockchain platform simultaneously. Markets - There are many blockchains creating decentralized marketplaces including Origami, District0x, OpenBazaar, and Syscoin\u2019s marketplace, but the offering of products are relatively low on each independent platform. A dApp that utilizes XRouter to aggregate all the products into a single hub would offer a lot more options to users and a fuller marketplace. It can also make publishing products easier by publishing to all platforms simultaneously through a single form, offering more exposure than posting to a single marketplace while saving time. Business and Industry - There are many dApps and blockchains that will end up using health data. Rather than submitting health data to each application, a universal EHR (Electronic Health Record) blockchain can be created to manage personal medical data and accessibility of data by each application. The health data on this EHR ledger can be shared amongst healthcare providers, hospitals, and insurance blockchains, dApps, and applications via XRouter. Certifications - Certifications and licensing records can be stored on a dedicated blockchain where they could be verified by a dApp built on the Blocknet Protocol. These records can be used to confirm qualifications and grant access or permissions. // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

Addresses are used similar to bank account routing and checking numbers to tell the network where to send and receive funds during transactions. The address by default is a 34 character alphanumeric string, but an alias can also be created as a more user-friendly naming preference to refer to the wallet's default address. Within each address there can exist multiple UTXOs , also called Inputs . B \u00b6 BLOCK \u00b6 BLOCK is the utility token for the Blocknet network. Unlike USD where the smallest denomination is $0.01, the smallest incremental unit of BLOCK is 0.00000001 BLOCK. Blockchain Block \u00b6 A block is a record of transaction data in a set period of time ( block time ). A time-series collection of the blocks makes up the blockchain (a chain of blocks). Blockchain \u00b6 A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks , which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. Block DX \u00b6 Block DX is a decentralized exchange dApp built with the Blocknet Protocol to showcase what can be built using it. Blocknet \u00b6 Blocknet is a self-funded and self-governed open source project with contributors around the world building an open and collaborative ecosystem with the development of the Blocknet Protocol . Blocknet Protocol \u00b6 The Blocknet Protocol is a blockchain interoperablity protocol that consists of 3 components: XBridge , XRouter , and XCloud . Block Reward \u00b6 A block reward is a reward you earn when staking for helping secure the network. Block Time \u00b6 Block time defines the time it takes to mine a block . In all blockchains there is an expected block time. In Blocknet , the expected block time is 1 minute. C \u00b6 Change Address \u00b6 A change address is the address where the 'change' of a transaction is returned to your wallet. This is always an address you own. If your wallet uses a UTXO of 20 BLOCK to fund a transaction in which you are sending only 15 BLOCK, then the remaining 5 BLOCK 'change' from the transaction will be returned to your wallet in the change address. This is similar to the concept of paying for an $15 item with a $20 bill and receiving $5 back as change. Client \u00b6 Depending on the context, client refers either to hardware running the Blocknet blockchain or software utilizing the Blocknet Protocol, which can be a blockchain, microservice, dApp, mobile app, website, etc. Coin \u00b6 Coin and token refers to digital assets . Coin Control \u00b6 Coin Control gives the ability to break up or combine inputs . This is comparable to going to a bank and exchanging a bunch of smaller bills for a $50 bill or breaking a larger bills for smaller denominations. Using Coin Control you can also choose to select specific inputs, addresses, and change addresses to use for transactions. Confirmation \u00b6 When transactions are made, the transactions must go through a confirmation process, which validates the transaction to make sure it is authentic. Funds that are being confirmed cannot be used until 60 confirmations (about 60 minutes). D \u00b6 Decentralized Exchange \u00b6 Decentralized exchange is the process exchanging funds between 2 parties with no middlemen. This requires the four core functions of an exchange to be decentralized: storage of funds, order books, order matching, and settlement. DEX \u00b6 DEX is a short-hand acronym for a decentralized exchange . Digital Asset \u00b6 A digital asset is new asset class that describes digital cryptographic coins and tokens. These coins and tokens can represent monetary characteristics (cryptocurrency), digital or virtual goods (unique tokenized items, such as music or art), and ownership (tokenized shares, such as of land or a company). E \u00b6 Encrypted \u00b6 Encrypting your wallet adds an additional level of security. An encrypted wallet requires a passphrase set by the user to spend funds the wallet. Enterprise XRouter \u00b6 An Enterprise XRouter Service Node (also called an EXR Service Node) is a Service Node which services XRouter , XBridge and XCloud requests from two different networks simultaneously: The original Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Blocknet network of Service Nodes An HTTP based, high performance, metered P2P network of Service Nodes Here are architectural diagrams of the current and future versions of Hydra Service Nodes. These illustrate the implementation details of an Enterprise XRouter and its relationship to a Hydra Service Node: See this guide to learn about hosting Blocknet's XQuery and Hydra services on a Service Node. EVM \u00b6 EVM stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine . It refers to any blockchain which supports smart contracts in the style of Ethereum. These include blockchains like Ethereum/ETH, Avalanche/AVAX, Binance Smart Chain/BSC, Fantom/FTM, Solana/SOL, Polkadot/DOT, Cardano/ADA, etc. EXR \u00b6 EXR stands for Enterprise XRouter . See Enterprise XRouter EXR ENV \u00b6 EXR ENV stands for Enterprise XRouter Environment - an environment set up by running the Global Install Script for Enterprise XRouter Environment . F \u00b6 Funds \u00b6 Funds refers to your digital assets . G \u00b6 GETH \u00b6 GETH stands for Go ETH . It is an implementation of the Ethereum core node protocol written in Golang. H \u00b6 Hydra \u00b6 A Hydra Service Node is simply an Enterprise XRouter Service Node which hosts EVM . A Hydra Service Node can also be easily configured to provide XQuery services, since Hydra and XQuery services share the same payment mechanism, the same reverse proxy services, and the same hosted EVM blockchains. These architectural diagrams illustrate the implementation details of a Hydra Service Node: See this guide to learn about hosting Blocknet's XQuery and Hydra services on a Service Node. I \u00b6 Indexer \u00b6 An Indexing service makes blockchain data readily accessible to developers via an SQL-style database query protocol. The Blocknet Indexer, called \"XQuery,\" makes indexed data from EVM blockchains, (and potentially non-EVM blockchains), readily available to developers in a decentralized fashion. A decentralized indexing service is vital to DApps which need ready access to blockchain data and want to maintain their status as a DApp (Decentralized Application). Note, since XQuery and Hydra services share the same payment mechanism, the same reverse proxy services, and the same hosted EVM blockchains, a Service Node set up to provide XQuery services can easily be configured to also provide Hydra services. See this guide to learn about hosting Blocknet's XQuery and Hydra services on a Service Node. Input \u00b6 Within a users wallet , the total balance is composed of either one large input or various smaller inputs . Think of an input as a bill in a physical wallet. You can have $100 in your wallet, but that may be composed of a single $100 bill, 5 $20 bills, etc. There are also addresses within each wallet. Each address can contain multiple inputs. An input is sometimes also referred to as a UTXO . Interchain Communication \u00b6 Interchain communication is the ability for different blockchains to interact and communicate with each other. For example, one blockchain can write their latest block hashes to the Bitcoin blockchain and also call the data to add extra verification and security. Interoperability \u00b6 Blockchain interoperability is the ability for different blockchains to operate, interact, and communicate with one another. Interoperability comes in two parts: exchange and communication . L \u00b6 Locked \u00b6 By having the wallet locked , funds cannot be sent and staking cannot be enabled. Unlocking the wallet, by entering in the passphrase(created when encrypting the wallet), is required to send funds and also allows staking to be enabled. The wallet can also be partially unlocked, which allows just for staking to be enabled, but does not allow the user to send funds. Lite Wallet \u00b6 A lite wallet is a wallet that does not require the full blockchain in order to function. It instead uses an external data source to provide SPV functionality. M \u00b6 Mint \u00b6 Minting is the process of generating new digital assets on a blockchain that did not exist in any previous blocks . Multiwallet \u00b6 A multiwallet is a wallet that can store multiple types of digital assets . N \u00b6 Naked Node \u00b6 A naked node is a Service Node that does not run any xwallets . Network \u00b6 Network refers to the collection of peers and data on the blockchain. Non-custodial \u00b6 Non-custodial means the user has 100% control of their funds . A third party has no control over it and cannot gain control if they wanted to. O \u00b6 Open Source \u00b6 Open source is used to describe software for which the source code is made freely available for contribution, redistributed, and modification. P \u00b6 Peers \u00b6 Peers are other wallets that you are connected to that help confirm transactions and share updated blocks and data between. When the wallet is not in sync, the wallet is brought up-to-date by syncing with information from peers. Proof-of-Stake \u00b6 Proof-of-stake , also known as PoS, is a type of algorithm by which a blockchain network achieves distributed consensus. Proposals \u00b6 Proposals are requests for funding for contributions to the Blocknet ecosystem. Each Superblock period, new proposals are submitted and BLOCK holders can cast 1 vote on these proposals for every 5000 BLOCK they own. See details here R \u00b6 Reward \u00b6 A reward refers to a payment earned for providing a service. S \u00b6 Service Node \u00b6 Service Nodes provide services to the Blocknet network . Read about Service Nodes here Snode \u00b6 Snode is a short-hand term to refer to a Service Node . SPV \u00b6 SPV is an acronym that stands for Simplified Payment Verification . It is a method of verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire blockchain. An SPV wallet is a wallet which enables SPV by hosting the full blockchain so the client requesting the SPV doesn't have to. Blocknet Service Nodes host multiple SPV wallets and thereby allow SPV for multiple blockchains. Staking \u00b6 Staking is used to secure the network by confirming blocks . Users that stake earn rewards. The reward can be referred to as a stake . When users earn a staking reward, it is tied to a specific input in the user's wallet. For a user to stake, the option must be enabled. Superblock \u00b6 A Superblock refers to a specific block that occurs roughly once a month. The Superblock block finalizes the votes on any active proposals and makes funding payouts for any passing proposals. Syncing \u00b6 In order to make transactions or stake , the wallet needs to be up-to-date with the latest blockchain data. When a wallet is Out of Sync , it is not up-to-date. Alternatively, the wallet being synced means it is up-to-date. T \u00b6 Token \u00b6 Token and coin refers to digital assets . Transaction \u00b6 A transaction, similar to a bank transaction, is the process of transferring funds from one account to another.. U \u00b6 Unocked \u00b6 By having the wallet locked , funds cannot be sent and staking cannot be enabled. Unlocking the wallet, by entering in the passphrase(created when encrypting the wallet), is required to send funds and also allows staking to be enabled. The wallet can also be partially unlocked, which allows just for staking to be enabled, but does not allow the user to send funds. User \u00b6 Refers to someone whom has a the wallet program installed on their computer. This may sometimes also be referred to as a peer . UTXO \u00b6 UTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Output . Within a user's wallet , the total balance is composed of either one large UTXO or various smaller UTXOs. Think of a UTXO as a bill in a physical wallet. You can have $100 in your wallet, but that may be composed of a single $100 bill, 5 $20 bills, etc. There are also addresses within each wallet. Each address can contain multiple UTXOs. A UTXO is sometimes also referred to as an input . V \u00b6 Voting \u00b6 Voting is performed by Service Nodes to voice approval/disapproval of proposals . W \u00b6 Wallet \u00b6 A wallet is used to hold you funds of digital assets . This is the digital version of your physical wallet that holds physical money, very much like how your bank account works. Every wallet has one or more associated Addresses and each wallet address can contain multiple UTXOs , , also called Inputs .

These Service Nodes are used as a DHT network overlay to support XBridge , XRouter , and XCloud services. In order to support these services, they host full nodes of the blockchains the protocol is compatible with, serve oracle data, verify UTXOs, route communication between blockchains, and perform anti-spam and anti-DOS measures for the network. Explore Blocknet Network to see how many Service Nodes currently support each digital asset, and much, much more... Before an asset can be traded on BlockDX, it must be supported by one or more Service Nodes . Blocknet community members have created several web based services to make it easy to discover which assets are currently supported by Service Nodes. Some of these websites actually offer much more information about the Blocknet Network than just how many Service Nodes support each digital asset: To list all coins currently supported by Service Nodes for trading on BlockDX, open Tools->Debug Console in your Blocknet wallet and enter: dxGetNetworkTokens . If using the CLI Blocknet wallet, issue the command, ./blocknet-cli dxGetNetworkTokens from the directory where blocknet-cli is kept. CloudChainsServiceExplorer (Thank you @lucien !) BlocknetMonitor (Thank you @walkjivefly !) BlockDXServiceNodes (Thank you @BuzzkillB !) CryptoCoreExplorer (Thank you Telegram user @jimwal !) Raw Volume Data Staking Rewards Calculator Service Nodes require 5000 BLOCK . If seeking to acquire BLOCK, there are various options available . Operating a Service Node should be viewed as a business since the amount of revenue you generate is completely in your control. You can choose to provide as many services as you'd like. The more services you offer and the higher the quality service you provide, the greater the revenue you will be able to produce. You can also invest in your services by advertising them to developers and selling those services to them. You can develop relationships with developers and gather feedback on the type of services that they would find the most valuable and then capitalize on that by offering those services. For XBridge services, the fees for trades are currently set at a static 0.015 BLOCK taker fee per trade and are paid out to a random Service Node that supports both of the chains that the trade took place between. In a future update, these fees will be set to a percent of the trade for the taker. For XRouter and XCloud services, it's a free market model where you are able to specify the amount you want to charge for each call and users get to specify the maximum fee they are willing to pay. The more useful and/or computationally expensive the call, the more valuable it is to the user, and the more you can charge. XCloud service can vary widely and not everything requires coding. For instance, you can setup a plugin file that allows you to offer CoinMarketCap pricing info via your Service Node for developers to use on-chain. You can set this up in a minute without any programming. This is just one example of an extremely useful service for developers. Not only do they want access to this data, but offering it through Blocknet allows them to pay in crypto, which is much simpler than needing to deal with fiat payments paid via on-chain functions.

Special Kinds of \"Service Nodes\" for Advanced users \u00b6 For advanced users, there are 3 special kinds of nodes which are defined as follows: testSNODE : A testnet SNode (testSNODE) is an SNODE which runs on testnet instead of mainnet . The collateral for this type of SNode is in tBLOCK (testnet BLOCK) instead of mainnet BLOCK. TNODE : A Trading Node (TNODE) is an instance of Blocknet core which is not configured to run as a Service Node, but is still configured to connect via XBridge to all the coin wallets you deploy in the node configuration process. These connections allow a user to trade on XBridge between any coins deployed in the configuration process. It also allows, for example, a Blocknet CLI call to dxGetLocalTokens to return a list of all the coins you had chosen to support/deploy in the node configuration process. testTNODE : A testnet Trading Node (testTNODE) is simply a Trading Node which runs on the testnet instead of the mainnet . // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

These Service Nodes are used as a DHT network overlay to support XBridge , XRouter , and XCloud services. In order to support these services, they host full nodes of the blockchains the protocol is compatible with, serve oracle data, verify UTXOs, route communication between blockchains, and perform anti-spam and anti-DOS measures for the network. Explore Blocknet Network to see how many Service Nodes currently support each digital asset, and much, much more... Before an asset can be traded on BlockDX, it must be supported by one or more Service Nodes . Blocknet community members have created several web based services to make it easy to discover which assets are currently supported by Service Nodes. Some of these websites actually offer much more information about the Blocknet Network than just how many Service Nodes support each digital asset: To list all coins currently supported by Service Nodes for trading on BlockDX, open Tools->Debug Console in your Blocknet wallet and enter: dxGetNetworkTokens . If using the CLI Blocknet wallet, issue the command, ./blocknet-cli dxGetNetworkTokens from the directory where blocknet-cli is kept. CloudChainsServiceExplorer (Thank you @lucien !) BlocknetMonitor (Thank you @walkjivefly !) BlockDXServiceNodes (Thank you @BuzzkillB !) CryptoCoreExplorer (Thank you Telegram user @jimwal !) Raw Volume Data Staking Rewards Calculator Service Nodes require 5000 BLOCK . If seeking to acquire BLOCK, there are various options available . Operating a Service Node should be viewed as a business since the amount of revenue you generate is completely in your control. You can choose to provide as many services as you'd like. The more services you offer and the higher the quality service you provide, the greater the revenue you will be able to produce. You can also invest in your services by advertising them to developers and selling those services to them. You can develop relationships with developers and gather feedback on the type of services that they would find the most valuable and then capitalize on that by offering those services. For XBridge services, the fees for trades are currently set at a static 0.015 BLOCK taker fee per trade and are paid out to a random Service Node that supports both of the chains that the trade took place between. In a future update, these fees will be set to a percent of the trade for the taker. For XRouter and XCloud services, it's a free market model where you are able to specify the amount you want to charge for each call and users get to specify the maximum fee they are willing to pay. The more useful and/or computationally expensive the call, the more valuable it is to the user, and the more you can charge. XCloud service can vary widely and not everything requires coding.

For instructions on setting up a Service Node, see the Service Node Setup Guide . Service Node Staking \u00b6 To stake your Service Node collateral, you can enable staking as you normally would. The inputs used for your Service Node collateral are all tracked, so when you \"hit\" a stake and it generates a new input it will auto-register for you to keep the Service Node active. After a stake, the Service Node is still active for all existing clients, but will be inactive for new clients until the 2 confirmations are complete. Note : If you register the Service Node from a collateral wallet then import the Service Node's BLOCK address to another machine for staking, the Service Node will go offline. Make sure you register the Service Node ( servicenoderegister ) from the machine that will be staking so that it will know to auto-register on stake. Check Service Node Status \u00b6 On the SNode wallet you can use servicenodestatus . On the Collateral wallet you can use servicenodelist . If you're using the command line you can filter the list with blocknet-cli servicenode list | sed -n '/\"snodekey\": \"#####/,/},/p' , replacing ##### with your Service Node's snodekey. Example: ./blocknet-cli servicenode list | sed -n '/\"snodekey\": \"\\(0b38bfac90cc5c683b6a27f952b2346a1009fc0f9c1a0790809f185ab27b14ecc6\\)/,/},/p You can also filter for multiple Service Nodes by separating each snodekey with \\| . Example: ./blocknet-cli servicenode list | sed -n '/\"snodekey\": \"\\(#####\\|#####\\|#####\\)/,/},/p Updated Your Blocknet Wallets \u00b6 If you have just updated your Collateral Computer wallet and SNode Computer wallet, follow these instructions: Open the Collateral Computer wallet and let it sync. Open the SNode Computer wallet and let it sync. From the Collateral Computer wallet, re-register the node with the servicenoderegister command. From the SNode Computer wallet, send the network ping with servicenodesendping . Restarted Your SNode Computer Wallet \u00b6 If you have just restarted your SNode Computer wallet, follow these instructions: Open the SNode Computer wallet and let it sync. From the SNode Computer, check if your Service Nodes status still shows \"running\" with the servicenodestatus command. If they show \"status\": \"running\" then you don't need to do anything. If they show \"offline\" then continue. From the Collateral Computer wallet, re-register the node with the servicenoderegister command.

Restarted Your Collateral Computer Wallet \u00b6 If you have just restarted your Collateral Computer wallet you don't need to do anything. Updated Your SNode Computer blocknet.conf \u00b6 If you have just updated the blocknet.conf on your SNode Computer wallet, follow these instructions: Restart the SNode Computer wallet and let it sync. Open the Collateral Computer wallet and let it sync. From the SNode Computer, check if your Service Nodes status still shows \"running\" with the servicenodestatus command. If they show \"status\": \"running\" then you don't need to do anything. If they show \"offline\" then continue. From the Collateral Computer wallet, re-register the node with the servicenoderegister command. From the SNode Computer wallet, send the network ping with servicenodesendping . Updated Your SNode Computer xbridge.conf \u00b6 If you have just updated the xbridge.conf on your SNode Computer wallet, follow these instructions: Add the blockchains you want to add trading support for in the ExchangeWallets= entry in xbridge.conf , denoted by the chain's asset's ticker. Separate each wallet name with a comma (no space). You can keep the rest of the configuration body the same, only the ExchangeWallets= setting needs to be updated (unless adding new support). Example: ExchangeWallets=BLOCK,LTC,BTC,SYS,DGB Restart the Blocknet wallet or use the dxLoadXBridgeConf command (from either the Debug Console or the command line) to load the updated settings. Use servicenodesendping to propogate these new settings to the network immediately or wait up to 3 minutes for this to happen automatically. You can view the blockchains you are supporting with the dxGetLocalTokens command. Updated XRouter Services or Configs \u00b6 If you have just updated the xrouter.conf on your SNode Computer wallet, follow these instructions: Add the chains you want to support SPV calls for in the wallets= entry in xrouter.conf , denoted by the chain's asset's ticker. Separate each wallet name with a comma. Example: wallets=SYS,BLOCK,BTC,ETH,MNP If you added or removed blockchain support, make sure to also update the rpcthreads= value in the blocknet.conf file. Use xrReloadConfigs to load your newly configured settings to xrouter.conf without needing to restart your Service Node. Use servicenodesendping to propogate these new settings to the network immediately or wait up to 3 minutes for this to happen automatically. You can view your configs using xrStatus . Updated XCloud Services or Plugin Files \u00b6 If you have just updated your XCloud services or plugin files, follow these instructions: Add the service name to the plugins= entry in xrouter.conf . The service name listed must be the exact name of your config file without the file extension. Separate each service name with a comma. Example: If you had 3 services that you wanted to deploy with config names eth_getBalance.conf , eth_blockNumber.conf , and weatherData.conf , the plugins= setting would read as follows: plugins=eth_getBalance,eth_blockNumber,weatherData Use xrReloadConfigs to load your newly configured settings to xrouter.conf without needing to restart your Service Node. Use servicenodesendping to propogate these new settings to the network immediately or wait up to 3 minutes for this to happen automatically. You can view your configs using xrStatus ( See example output ). Post your services to the forum so others can discover, learn more, and find instructions on how to interact with your service.

Operating a Service Node requires 5000 BLOCK collateral. This 5000 BLOCK collateral will still be in your wallet and in your control, but must not be moved or spent in order for the Service Node to remain valid and active. However, you may still use this collateral to participate in staking. Operating as a Service Node requires two Blocknet wallets: Collateral Wallet - This wallet will contain the 5000 BLOCK collateral and does NOT need to remain online and unlocked unless the 5000 BLOCK is being staked or you are voting on a proposal . Service Node Wallet - This wallet will act as the Service Node and must remain online and open at all times. Hardware Requirements For Service Node Wallet \u00b6 Hardware Requirements For Service Node Wallet Hardware requirements for a Service Node vary depending on which SPV wallets and services your node will support. Minimum System Probably the minumum HW requirements for any Service Node would be: 4 CPU cores (or 4 vCPUs if the Service Node runs on a VPS) 8 GB RAM 200 GB SSD Storage (doubtful that slower, HDD drives would work). 25+MBit/s Internet download speed. (100+ MBit/s is much better for faster syncing.) Such a system could support a few small SPV wallets and a Blocknet staking wallet. Medium & Large Systems If you want to host the Hydra and/or XQuery Indexer services (and maybe a few SPV wallets as well), you'll likely need at least 10 vCPUs, 60 GB of RAM and 1.3 TB+ of SSD storage space. Hosting Hydra or XQuery services requires hosting an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain like Ethereum/ETH, Avalanche/AVAX, Sys NEVM, Binance Smart Chain/BSC, Fantom/FTM, Solana/SOL, Polkadot/DOT, Cardano/ADA, etc. So far, testing of XQuery suggests it should be possible to host XQuery services supporting EVMs like AVAX, Sys NEVM & BSC on HW with these same specs, though it may be necessary to add extra storage to support the rapidly growing AVAX blockchain. Minumum HW requirements for a medium to large Service Node capable of supporting Hydra and/or XQuery Indexer services would be something like this: 10 CPU cores (or 10 vCPUs if the Service Node runs on a VPS) 60 GB RAM 1.3+ TB SSD Storage 25+MBit/s Internet download speed (100+ MBit/s is much better for faster syncing.) To give an estimate of how much storage space is required for various SPV wallets, here is a snapshot of approximate disk space utilizations taken May 18, 2022: Snapshot of SPV wallet disk space utilizations taken April 8, 2022 SPV wallet Estimated Size (GB) bitcoin 500 dogecoin 70 litecoin 85 dash 35 digibyte 33 raven 32 pivx 22 verge 11 crown 9 phore 8 unobtanium 4 lux 4 blocknet 5 terracoincore 4 alqocrypto 4 monetaryunit 5 syscoin 6 merge 4 zenzo 4 goldcoin 3 egulden 3 stakecubecoin 2 VPS Provider Options for Small, Medium & Large Systems If you want to compare prices between VPS service providers, you can compare the offerings of companies like Digital Ocean , Contabo , Vultr , Amazon AWS , and Google Cloud Computing . A Google search for \"VPS Hosting Service Provider\" will show many more options. As of this writing, Contabo seems to offer the most hardware for the money, but it's always good to do a little comparison shopping. Extra Large System for supporting ETH archival node To support Hydra and/or XQuery Indexer services of the Ethereum/ETH blockchain, a Service Node must host an ETH archival node. In terms of CPU and RAM requirements, running an ETH archival node requires: 8 CPU Cores (or 8 vCPUs if the ETH archival Node runs on a VPS) 16 GB RAM The storage space requirements for an ETH archival node are a bit more demanding. The Go-Ethereum (GETH) archival node, which is the core wallet needed to run an ETH archival node, occupies about 8TB of space as of this writing (July 17, 2021). Furthermore, it is growing by 3TB per year. (Its current size can be found here .) Therefore, a Service Node supporting an ETH archival node should probably have at least 10TB for ETH alone, plus maybe another 1.5-2TB for running other SPV wallets. It should also have the ability to expand its storage space by 3TB per year. Update Sept. 27, 2021: Some Blocknet community members are researching the possibility of using the Erigon ETH archival node instead of the Go ETH (GETH) archival node. This is promising research as the Erigon ETH archival node occupies only about a quarter of the space of the GETH archival node. In other words, only about 2TB instead of 8TB as of this writing. Erigon ETH archival node also syncs in about one quarter the time it takes GETH to sync. As of this writing, it appears Erigon ETH may well be able to support Hydra services of ETH in its current stage of development, but until Erigon has standard ETH filter methods, it won't support XQuery services of ETH. Please join discussions in the #hydra channel of Blocknet Discord to keep up with the latest developments on Erigon ETH. It's also important to note that the storage for the ETH full archival node must be very fast. In other words, it must use SSDs, not HDDs. There are 3 types of SSDs: SATA, SAS and NVMe/PCIe. Of the 3, SATA are the slowest, SAS are a little faster, and NVMe are by far the fastest. NVMe are definitely the preferred variety of SSD drive when it comes to hosting an ETH archival node. In fact, it looks doubtful that SATA or SAS SSD drives will be fast enough to allow the ETH node to sync. It is also recommended that the SSDs used for an ETH archival node be configured in a RAID mirror configuration (e.g. RAID-1, RAID-10, RAID-Z2). Without RAID mirroring, an SSD failure will almost certainly mean you'll have to resync the entire ETH full archival node, which takes over a month for a GETH node (but probably only a quarter of that time for an Erigon ETH node). Your ETH archival node will be offline for the duration of the resync. As of this writing, it's not clear that any of the VPS Provider Options mentioned above are capable of providing a VPS which meets the HW requirements for an ETH archival node, or if they are capable, the cost can be a bit extreme and it's not clear they can expand storage space as needed to support the growing ETH full archival node. There may well be some smaller VPS providers who are capable of both meeting current HW requirements and allowing for storage space expansion in the future. There are also efforts underway to coordinate \"package discounts\" from such VPS provider(s) for a person or group of people to rent a number of ETH archival-capable VPS's at a discounted rate. Please join discussions on this topic in the #hydra channel of Blocknet Discord . Another option for meeting the HW requirements of an ETH archival node is to purchase your own hardware and run it at home or in a colocation hosting data center. (Colocation hosting services can be found for USD $50 per month per server, as of Feb., 2022.) If purchasing your own SSD drives, be aware that ETH core will be writing to your SSDs continuously, so you'll want to get SSDs with a high \"durability\" rating. For example, a company called Sabrent offers an 8TB NVMe SSD. On the surface, it may look like a good choice to use for building a system with lots of fast storage space. Unfortunately, this particular drive only has a TBW (Total Bytes Written) durability rating of 1,800 TB TBW, which, according to this review makes it not very suitable to be used in an application that writes to it frequently. (Note, Samsung NVMe drives and/or any NVMe drives rated for industrial use are probably quite durable and suitable for supporting an archival ETH node.) More discussions about HW details can be found in the #hydra channel of Blocknet Discord . Running a Collateral or Staking Wallet and a Service Node Wallet on the same computer \u00b6 Click Here to learn about running a Collateral or Staking Wallet and a Service Node Wallet on the same computer. Do this before setting up your Service Node. Service Node operators will often want to run a Collateral Wallet or a Staking Wallet on the same computer as their Service Node Wallet . In almost all cases, the Collateral Wallet will also be staking , so we can say it is also a Staking Wallet . A Staking Wallet , however, is not always used as a Collateral Wallet . To run a Staking Wallet and a Service Node Wallet on the same computer, follow these steps: Set up your Staking Wallet . Here is an example guide for setting up a Staking Wallet on a VPS running Ubuntu Linux . The Hardware Requirements for a Service Node Wallet should be followed when selecting a VPS as per that guide. Stop your Staking Wallet . If your Staking Wallet has been set up according to the VPS Staking guide , and the alias for blocknet-cli has also been set up according to that guide, you can stop your Staking Wallet by issuing the follow command: blocknet-cli stop Change the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) port and the RPC port of your Staking Wallet so they don't conflict with the P2P port and the RPC port of your Service Node Wallet . To do this on a Linux system, Change directory to your Staking Wallet data directory. If your Staking Wallet has been set up according to the VPS Staking guide , your Staking Wallet data directory will be ~/.blocknet . For Example: cd ~/.blocknet Use a simple text editor like vi or nano to edit the wallet configuration file, blocknet.conf . For Example: nano blocknet.conf Note, editing blocknet.conf will create blocknet.conf if it doesn't already exist. Add two lines like the following to your blocknet.conf : port=41413 rpcport=41415 Note: The port and rpcport values you set in your blocknet.conf don't have to be 41413 and 41415, as in the example above; they just have to be port numbers which are not used as either port or rpcport in the default Blocknet wallet configuration. Therefore you must not use 41412 or 41414, which are the default values for port and rpcport , respectively. You should also not use the default port or rpcport values for Blocknet testnet, which are 41474 and 41419, respectively. Incrementing the default Blocknet port and rpcport values by 1, as in the example above, is a pretty safe strategy for avoiding potential port conflicts. Not only does this avoid potential port conflicts with the Blocknet testnet, but also with other SPV wallets running on your Service Node. Save your edits to blocknet.conf , exit the editor and restart your Staking Wallet . If your Staking Wallet has been set up according to the VPS Staking guide , and the aliases for blocknet-cli , blocknet-daemon and blocknet-unlock have also been set up according to that guide, you can restart your Staking Wallet and start it staking again by issuing the follow commands: blocknet-daemon (You'll need to wait a few minutes after starting the Blocknet daemon for your wallet to sync the headers. Then you'll be allowed to unlock your wallet for staking in the next step.) Unlock your staking wallet for staking only: blocknet-unlock (Enter your wallet password when prompted.) Confirm your wallet is staking by issuing the command: blocknet-cli getstakingstatus When this command returns, \"status\": \"Staking is active\" , then you know your wallet is staking properly. Note, you may also want to confirm your staking wallet balance is correct with: blocknet-cli getbalance If you will be setting up your Service Node following the Enterprise XRouter Environment Service Node Setup Guide , there is nothing more you need to do regarding your Staking Wallet and you can proceed directly to the Enterprise XRouter Environment Service Node Setup Guide . However, if you will be setting up your Service Node following the Manual Service Node Setup Guide , you'll need to move your Staking Wallet data directory to allow the Service Node Wallet data directory to occupy the default data directory location . To move your Staking Wallet data directory, follow these steps: Stop your Staking Wallet . If your Staking Wallet has been set up according to the VPS Staking guide , and the alias for blocknet-cli has also been set up according to that guide, you can stop your Staking Wallet with: blocknet-cli stop Wait till your Staking Wallet stops completely. You can monitor the Staking Wallet Linux process (called blocknetd ) by repeatedly pasting/issuing the following command: ps x -o args | grep -v \"grep\" | grep \"blocknetd\" Before the Staking Wallet Linux process has stopped completely, that command will return something like this: /home/[user]/blocknet-4.3.3/bin/blocknetd -daemon Continue issuing that ps x -o args command until it returns nothing. Then you know the blocknetd process has stopped completely and it's safe to move your data directory. Issue the following commands to move (rename) your Staking Wallet data directory: cd ~ mv .blocknet .blocknet_staking Now, assuming your Staking Wallet access aliases have been set up according to the VPS Staking guide , you'll need to change those alias definitions to reflect the fact that your Staking Wallet data directory has changed. To do so, use vi or nano to edit the ~/.bash_aliases file. For Example: nano ~/.bash_aliases Leave the first line of the file as it is: export BLOCKNET_VERSION='4.3.3' With 4.3.3 being replaced by whatever version of Blocknet wallet your Staking Wallet is running. Then change all the alias definitions to be as follows: export BLOCKNET_VERSION='4.3.3' # blocknet-daemon = Start Blocknet daemon for staking wallet alias blocknet-daemon='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknetd -daemon -datadir=$HOME/.blocknet_staking/' # blocknet-cli = Staking wallet Command Line Interface alias blocknet-cli='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknet-cli -datadir=$HOME/.blocknet_staking/' # blocknet-unlock = Unlock staking wallet for staking only alias blocknet-unlock='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknet-cli -datadir=$HOME/.blocknet_staking/ walletpassphrase \"$(read -sp \"Enter Password:\" undo; echo $undo;undo=)\" 9999999999 true' # blocknet-unlockfull = Unlock staking wallet fully alias blocknet-unlockfull='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknet-cli -datadir=$HOME/.blocknet_staking/ walletpassphrase \"$(read -sp \"Enter Password:\" undo; echo $undo;undo=)\" 9999999999 false' Save your edits to ~/.bash_aliases , exit the editor, then activate your new alias definitions with: source ~/.bash_aliases Restart your staking wallet with: blocknet-daemon Unlock your staking wallet for staking only: blocknet-unlock (Enter your wallet password when prompted.) Confirm your wallet is staking by issuing the command: blocknet-cli getstakingstatus When this command returns, \"status\": \"Staking is active\" , then you know your wallet is staking properly. Note, you may also want to confirm your staking wallet balance is correct with: blocknet-cli getbalance Enterprise XRouter Environment Service Node Setup - Docker based (Recommended) \u00b6 Note: This Enterprise XRouter ( EXR ) Environment Service Node Setup Guide is for setting up a Service Node on a computer running Ubuntu Linux OS. Please adjust any Ubuntu-specific steps as necessary if setting up your Service Node on a different OS. To setup your Service Node using the Enterprise XRouter Environment Service Node Setup, complete the following guides in order: Set up an Ubuntu Linux server Collateral Wallet Setup for EXR Service Node Deploy Enterprise XRouter Environment Maintenance of Enterprise XRouter Environment Set up an Ubuntu Linux server \u00b6 Set up an Ubuntu Linux server Follow these steps to set up a Virtual Private Server (VPS) running Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS Linux Operating System. Please make sure the VPS you set up meets the hardware requirements for a Service Node . Note: The instructions below assume bash shell, the default shell for Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS Linux, is used. Please adjust as necessary if a different shell is used. If you're new to the Linux Command Line Interface (CLI), learn the basics . You don't have to learn every detail, but learn to navigate the file system, move and remove files and directories, and edit text files with vi , vim or nano . Sign up for an account at an economical, reliable VPS provider. For example, you may wish to explore services available from VPS providers like Contabo , Digital Ocean , Vultr , Amazon AWS and Google Cloud Computing . A Google search for \"VPS hosting provider\" will yield a multitude of other options. You'll want to rent and deploy a VPS running Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS Linux through your VPS provider. Follow the guides available from your VPS provider to launch your Ubuntu VPS and connect to it via ssh (from Mac or Linux Terminal) or via PuTTY (from Windows). For example, here is a nice Quick Start Guide from Digital Ocean , and here is a guide from Contabo on connecting to your VPS . The first time you connect to your VPS, you'll be logged in as root user. Create a new user with the following command, replacing <username> with a username of your choice. adduser <username> You will be prompted for a password. Enter a password for <username> , different from your root password, and store it in a safe place. You will also see prompts for user information, but these can be left blank. Once the new user has been created, add it to the sudo group so it can perform commands as root. Only commands/applications run with sudo will run with root privileges. Others run with regular privileges, so type the following command with your <username> usermod -aG sudo <username> Type exit at the command prompt to end your Linux session and disconnect from your VPS. Reconnect to your VPS (via ssh or PuTTY ), but this time connect as the <username> you just added. Using ssh from Mac or Linux Terminal: ssh <username>@VPS_IP Example: ssh bob@104.22.10.214 Using PuTTY from Windows, configure PuTTY to use VPS_IP as before, but this time login to your VPS with the <username> and password you just set. Update list of available packages. (Enter password for <username> when prompted for the [sudo] password.) sudo apt update Upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages. sudo apt upgrade Make sure nano and unzip packages are installed. sudo apt install nano unzip Create at least as much swap space as you have RAM. So, if you have 16 GB or RAM, you should create at least 16 GB of swap space. Many recommend creating twice as much swap space as you have RAM, which is a good idea if you can spare the disk space. However, more than 16 GB of swap space may not be required. To create swap space: Check if your system already has swap space allocated: swapon --show If the results of swapon --show look similar to this: swapon --show NAME TYPE SIZE USED PRIO /swapfile file 2G 0B -2 that means you already have some swap space allocated and you should follow this guide to allocate 1x-2x more swap space than you have GB of RAM. If the results of swapon --show do not indicate that your system has a swapfile of type file , you'll need to create a new swap file with 1x-2x more swap space than you have GB of RAM. To do so, follow this guide (Highly Recommended) Increase the security of your VPS by setting up SSH Keys to restrict access to your VPS from any computer other than your own . Those connecting via PuTTY from Windows should first follow this guide to set up SSH Keys with PuTTY . Note: If you follow this recommendation to restrict access to your VPS via SSH Keys, back up your SSH Private key and save the password you choose to unlock your SSH Private Key. Continue on to Collateral Wallet Setup for EXR Service Node . Collateral Wallet Setup for EXR Service Node \u00b6 Collateral Wallet Setup for Automated Service Node Setup Create a new public address to hold collateral for your Service Node. It is recommended to create a new collateral address for each Service Node whose collateral will be stored in this wallet. A unique name for each collateral address will need to be chosen as an alias. We'll refer to this name below as ALIAS. To create a collateral address on the GUI/Qt wallet, there are 2 options: Select Address Book tab on the left side of the wallet, then select Create New Address at the top, then fill in the Alias field with your ALIAS and click Add Address . Navigate to Tools->Debug Console and type: getnewaddress ALIAS For Example: getnewaddress snode01 The getnewaddress command will return a new address, like BmpZVb522wYmryYLDy6EckqGN4g8pT6tNP To create a collateral address on the CLI wallet: blocknet-cli getnewaddress ALIAS For Example: blocknet-cli getnewaddress snode01 The getnewaddress command will return a new address, like BmpZVb522wYmryYLDy6EckqGN4g8pT6tNP Create the inputs needed for the collateral address. Each address where collateral funds for a Service Node are stored must meet the following requirements: Collateral Address Requirements \u00b6 There must be 10 or fewer inputs in the address whose sum is >= 5000 BLOCK. There can be other inputs in the address which don't factor into this calculation, but it must be possible to add 10 or fewer inputs in the address to achieve a sum of >= 5000 BLOCK. If you want the address to qualify for 1 Superblock vote (recommended), you should create one small input to the address, ideally around 1 BLOCK in size, which is separate from the inputs used to meet the 5000 BLOCK requirement listed above. If you want the address to qualify for 1 Superblock vote (recommended), you should also ensure that the set of inputs used to meet the 5000 BLOCK requirement are all 100 BLOCK or larger in size. To fund a collateral address such that it meets these requirements, there are two options: Manual Funding or servicenodecreateinputs . Use one of these two options ( a or b ): Manual Funding: (recommended) Each time you send BLOCK to the collateral address, it creates an input to the address whose size is equal to the amount sent. So, to meet all the above requirements , you could send 1 BLOCK to the collateral address, then send BLOCK in amounts of >= 500 and <= 5000 BLOCK to the same collateral address until the sum of the >= 500 BLOCK inputs is >=5000. For example, you could send 1 BLOCK to the collateral address, then send 1250 BLOCK to the collateral address 4 times. After doing so, the collateral address would have 5 inputs : 1 input of 1 BLOCK and 4 inputs of 1250 BLOCK each. This would meet the above requirements . As another example, you could send 1 BLOCK to the collateral address, then send 5000 BLOCK to the same collateral address. That would leave the collateral address with 2 inputs : 1 input of 1 BLOCK and 1 input of 5000 BLOCK. This would also meet the above requirements . Note: If you are sending to the collateral address from the same wallet which contains the collateral address (and possibly other collateral addreses), it will be good to either lock the inputs of funds in collateral addresses , or send the funds using the Coin Controlled Sending feature to ensure the funds you're sending are not withdrawn from a collateral address you're trying to fund. It's easiest to perform coin controlled sending from the redesigned GUI/Qt wallet . However, if sending from a CLI wallet, you can use methods like createrawtransaction and sendrawtransaction to accomplish coin controlled sending. Get help on using these methods in the CLI wallet with: blocknet-cli help createrawtransaction and blocknet-cli help sendrawtransaction . Tip: Click here to learn how to see all inputs of a collateral address. In a redesigned GUI/Qt wallet : Select Window->Coin Control to display the addresses and Inputs where funds are stored in your wallet: This will display a screen like this ( in Tree mode ): On this screen you can click the small grey triangle to the left of an address to see the Inputs of the address. In a CLI wallet, or in Tools->Debug Console of the GUI/Qt wallet: Use the listunspent method to list all wallet Inputs and their associated addresses. From the CLI wallet: blocknet-cli listunspent From Tools->Debug Console of the GUI/Qt wallet: listunspent servicenodecreateinputs : servicenodecreateinputs is a method/tool of the Blocknet core wallet which can facillitate creating a set of inputs in a collateral address which meets the above requirements . Not only does it automatically create a set of inputs which meets the requirements , it also automatically creates a 1 block input to the collateral address to make the address eligible for voting . NOTE: If your wallet contains other collateral addresses which have already been funded, you'll want to lock the inputs of funds in all collateral addresses to prevent servicenodecreateinputs from withdrawing funds from other collateral addresses when it's called. NOTE: It is possible to use servicenodecreateinputs to set up collateral for multiple Service Nodes in a single collateral address. However, because this practice makes it difficult for tracking tools to associate collateral addresses with Service Nodes, the recommendation is to use a separate collateral address for each Service Node's collateral. Effectively, this means the recommendation is to always pass a NODE_COUNT parameter of 1 , or just leave the NODE_COUNT blank so it will default to 1 when calling servicenodecreateinputs . (See examples below.) To use the servicenodecreateinputs method/tool, your collateral wallet should contain at least 1 BLOCK to cover the transaction fee of calling the servicenodecreateinputs method, and at least 5001 BLOCK for each Service Node collateral you want to set up. Once those conditions are met, you can use the servicenodecreateinputs method like this: From Tools->Debug Console of the GUI/Qt wallet: servicenodecreateinputs NODE_ADDRESS NODE_COUNT INPUT_SIZE From the CLI wallet: blocknet-cli servicenodecreateinputs NODE_ADDRESS NODE_COUNT INPUT_SIZE In these examples, replace NODE_ADDRESS , NODE_COUNT and INPUT_SIZE with the desired values, as per the following definitions: NODE_ADDRESS = The collateral address created in step 1 above. NODE_COUNT = The number of Service Nodes for which to configure the collateral address. It is recommended to make this 1, or just leave it blank so it will default to 1. However, as mentioned, it is possible to configure a single collateral address to provide collateral for multiple Service Nodes. INPUT_SIZE = The amount of BLOCK for each input of the collateral address. Must be >= 500 and <= 5000 . If left blank, it defaults to 1250 . Example: 1000 will create 5 inputs of 1000 BLOCK each (per Service Node) Example which creates 4 inputs of 1250 BLOCK each in the collateral address, for a single Service Node : servicenodecreateinputs BmpZVb522wYmryYLDy6EckqGN4g8pT6tNP Example which creates 2 inputs of 2500 BLOCK each in the collateral address, for a single Service Node : servicenodecreateinputs BmpZVb522wYmryYLDy6EckqGN4g8pT6tNP 1 2500 Example which creates 2 inputs of 2500 BLOCK each in the collateral address for each of 4 Service Nodes servicenodecreateinputs BmpZVb522wYmryYLDy6EckqGN4g8pT6tNP 4 2500 This last example will result in 8 inputs of 2500 BLOCK each being created in the collateral address (plus a 1 BLOCK input for voting). Prepare to create (or add a new entry to) a servicenode.conf file in your data directory . If the servicenode.conf file does not exist in your data directory, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, review the contents of servicenode.conf in an editor. If all the service node references in the file are out-of-date, exit the editor and delete the file. If some service node references are current/valid, but others are out-of-date, delete all lines containing out-of-date service node references, save the file and exit the editor. Create (or add a new entry to) a servicenode.conf configuration file. Use the servicenodesetup command as follows: From Tools->Debug Console of the GUI/Qt wallet: servicenodesetup NODE_ADDRESS ALIAS From the CLI wallet: blocknet-cli servicenodesetup NODE_ADDRESS ALIAS Where NODE_ADDRESS is the collateral address you created in step 1 above, and ALIAS is any name you want to give to your Service Node (or group of Service Nodes). The ALIAS you choose here doesn't have to be the same as the ALIAS you chose for your collateral address in step 1, but it is usually most convenient to use the same ALIAS. The servicenodesetup command will create an entry for the Service Node(s) in the servicenode.conf file in your collateral wallet data directory . Example: servicenodesetup BmpZVb522wYmryYLDy6EckqGN4g8pT6tNP snode01 { \"alias\": \"snode01\", \"tier\": \"SPV\", \"snodekey\": \"02a5d0279e484a3df81acd611e1052d2e0797e796564ecbc25c7fe19f36e9985e5\", \"snodeprivkey\": \"PswGMd6faZf1ceLojzGeKn7LQuXVwYgRQG8obUKrThZ8ap4pkRR7\", \"address\": \"BmpZVb522wYmryYLDy6EckqGN4g8pT6tNP\" } Copy the snodeprivkey and the address returned in the previous step and paste them into a temporary text file. You'll need them later on. (In the above example, snodeprivkey is PswGMd6faZf1ceLojzGeKn7LQuXVwYgRQG8obUKrThZ8ap4pkRR7 , and address is BmpZVb522wYmryYLDy6EckqGN4g8pT6tNP ). Note, both the snodeprivkey and the address of your Service Node are also stored at this point in the servicenode.conf file in your collateral wallet data directory, so you can always find them there if you don't want to paste them into a temporary text file to record them. Restart the Collateral Wallet . For GUI/Qt wallet, simply close the Blocknet wallet application, then open it again. For CLI wallet (assuming aliases for blocknet-cli and blocknet-daemon have been set up according to the VPS Staking guide ): blocknet-cli stop blocknet-daemon Note, you will probably need to wait at least 30 seconds after issuing blocknet-cli stop or closing the GUI wallet app before you'll be allowed to relaunch blocknet-daemon or relaunch the GUI wallet. Just keep trying every 30 seconds or so to relaunch until you no longer get errors. Assuming you want to stake your collateral, unlock your staking wallet for staking only: For GUI/Qt wallet, unlock your wallet for staking only according to the staking guide for GUI wallet . For CLI wallet (assuming an alias for blocknet-unlock has been set up according to the VPS Staking guide ): blocknet-unlock (Enter your wallet password when prompted.) Confirm your wallet is staking with the getstakingstatus command. From Tools->Debug Console of the GUI/Qt wallet: getstakingstatus From the CLI wallet: blocknet-cli getstakingstatus When this command returns, \"status\": \"Staking is active\" , then you know your wallet is staking properly. Note, you may also want to confirm your staking wallet balance is correct with getbalance : From Tools->Debug Console of the GUI/Qt wallet: getbalance From the CLI wallet: blocknet-cli getbalance Continue on to Deploy Enterprise XRouter Environment . Deploy Enterprise XRouter Environment \u00b6 Deploy Enterprise XRouter Environment Firstly, log in to the Ubuntu Linux server you set up above , (log in as the user you created, not as root), then continue with this guide. Run Global Install Script for Enterprise XRouter Environment \u00b6 If you have never run the Enterprise XRouter Environment (EXR ENV) Global Install script on this server, or if you have not run it since 1 Oct, 2022, copy/paste these commands to run the Global Install script: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blocknetdx/exrproxy-env-scripts/main/env_installer.sh -o env_installer.sh chmod +x env_installer.sh ./env_installer.sh --install If the Global Install Script detects docker/docker-compose is already installed, it simply won't install new version(s). If it detect the ~/exrproxy-env directory already exists, it will update it. If it detects ~/exrproxy-env does not already exist, it will clone it from the Github repository and thereby create it. IMPORTANT: This Global Install Script will log you out after it's finished with phase 1 of the install. This is necessary to update the user's membership in the docker group of Linux and to activate the python version control system ( pyenv ). Simply log in again after it logs you out, then issue the following command again to complete phase 2 of the install: ./env_installer.sh --install Then follow the steps below. Tip: How to Change Python Version. Since the Global Install Script installs the pyenv tool, it's very easy to change the version of python used in deploying the EXR ENV. The default python version set by the install script is 3.9.14. If, for example, you want to run the EXR ENV deployment scripts using python version 3.10.7, simply do this: cd ~/exrproxy-env pyenv install 3.10.7 pyenv local 3.10.7 Note, before you run the builder.py script in the steps below, confirm that you have ~/.local/bin in your $PATH variable. You can check this simply like this: echo $PATH If you don't see ~/.local/bin (or /home/<user-name>/.local/bin ) listed as one of the directories in your $PATH, take steps to ensure it gets added to your $PATH on every login. For example, if you're on a system where ~/.profile is sourced on every login, you could add these lines to ~/.profile : # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\" # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\" Then do this to add ~/.local/bin to your $PATH: source ~/.profile Prepare to enter all the details you'll need when you run the builder.py script: Most likely, builder.py will automatically find your server's public IP address, but it will be good to know your server's IP so you can verify (in a future step) that builder.py has found it correctly. Some options for fetching your Service Node computer's Public IP include: curl ipconfig.io curl ifconfig.co dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com Fetch your Service Node computer's Public IP address, then copy/paste it to a temporary text file for easy access. Make sure you have easy copy/paste access to your Servicenode Private Key and Servicenode Address , which you got earlier from the Collateral Wallet Setup Procedure . Think of a name for your Service Node. It doesn't have to be the same name you chose to label the address of your Service Node during the Collateral Wallet Setup , but it's often convenient to use the same name. Note, there should be no spaces in the names you choose. Think of a name and a password for the RPC user your Service Node will use when communicating with the services/coins it supports. Change directory to your local exrproxy-env repository ( exrproxy-env is located in ~ by default.): cd ~/exrproxy-env Update your local repository and launch the SNode Builder: Assuming you have previously run the Global Install Script on this server, you can update your local environment repository and launch the SNode builder tool with this command: ./exr_env.sh --update --builder \"\" The --update parameter updates the local repository. The --builder \"\" parameter launches the builder.py tool when the update is complete. If you prefer, you can leave off the --builder \"\" parameter, then call ./builder.py standalone after ./exr_env.sh --update completes, like this: ./exr_env.sh --update ./builder.py IMPORTANT: When passing parameters to ./builder.py through ./exr_env.sh , the parameters of ./builder.py must follow the --builder parameter and they must all be enclosed in double quotes (\"). For example: ./exr_env.sh --builder \"--deploy\" ./exr_env.sh --builder \"--source autobuild/sources.yaml\" ./exr_env.sh --builder \"\" Parameters passed to ./builder.py when it's called as a standalone app do not require double quotes around them. For example: ./builder.py --source autobuild/sources.yaml --deploy First, builder.py will display some information about your system's available hardware resources. This information will be useful in the SNode configuration process. It will look something like this: builder.py will then check to see if the necessary environment, and the necessary versions of docker and docker-compose have been installed on your server. If not, it will instruct you to install them and exit. Next, it will prompt you for your sudo password. Enter your user password, not your root password. Next, it will ask you some questions about how you want to configure your Service Node. If at any time you want to change any of the answers you have given while configuring your SNode, simply issue Control-C to stop the configuration process, then run ./builder.py (or ./exr_env.sh --builder \"\" ) again. The first questions it will ask will be about your Public IP address, Service Node Name, Service Node Private Key, Service Node Address, RPC User and RPC Password. You should have the answers to all these questions already prepared from step 1 above. Next, you'll be presented with a series of queries about which services you want to support on your Service Node. The approximate amount of RAM, # of CPUs, and amount of DISK (SSD) storage space required to support each service will be displayed next to the service name. Note that the cumulative DISK storage space requirements of all the services you select to store data in a particular directory, must be less than the total amount of DISK storage space available in that directory. For example, the sum of the DISK requirements for all the services you select to store data in the /snode directory must be less than the total available space in the /snode directory. (Note, the available space on each of your server's mounted directories is displayed when you first run builder.py , as in step 4 above.) The RAM and CPU requirements for different services are not necessarily cumulative in the same way. For Example, ETH and AVAX both require 16 GB of RAM, but that doesn't necessarily mean you need 32 GB RAM to support both of them on your SNode. However, if you want to have the ability to sync both of them concurrently, or to guarantee optimal performance, then 32+ GB RAM would be recommended. The first services you'll be given the option to support will be the XBridge SPV blockchain services. In the following example, SPV blockchains DASH, LTC, PIVX and SYS have been selected to be supported as XBridge services: Next to each XBridge service in the list, the approximate RAM, # of CPU cores and DISK requirements for the blockchain are displayed. The default data mount directory ( /snode in this example) is also displayed for each blockchain. (In a later step, you'll be given the option to change the data mount directory for specific services.) If you want to change the global default data mount directory for all services you'll deploy, you can change it from /snode to some other directory by following this procedure: Change Global Default Data Mount Directory. Issue Control-C to stop builder.py if it's currently running. Make a copy of autobuild/sources.yaml . For example: cp autobuild/sources.yaml autobuild/my_custom_dir_sources.yaml Use a simple editor like vi or nano , to edit the copy you just made. For Example: vi autobuild/my_custom_dir_sources.yaml In the editor, search for all occurrances of /snode and replace them with whatever new global default you want for your data mount dir . Save the file and exit the editor. Run ./builder.py , passing it a parameter to specify the file you just edited as the source of available coins/services. For example: ./builder.py --source autobuild/my_custom_dir_sources.yaml Next, you'll be given the option to choose which EVM blockchains you want to support. In the following example, both ETH and AVAX EVM blockchains are selected to be supported: The HW requirements and default data mount directory ( /snode in this example) are displayed for each blockchain. Note: The HW requirements listed next to each EVM chain assume the EVM chain will be hosted internally , on the EXR ENV server itself. Supporting an externally hosted EVM does not add any HW requirements to the EXR ENV server. (In a later step, you'll be given the option to specify the Host IPs of the EVM blockchains your SNode will support externally .) If you chose to support EVM blockchains, you'll be given the option to support XQuery and/or Hydra services for each of the EVMs you'll support. If you chose to support XQuery, you'll be given the option to select which indices you want XQuery to support for each EVM you'll support. Supporting all available indices is recommended. For example: Next, if you chose to support XQuery and/or Hydra services, you'll be prompted to enter the US dollar amounts you want to charge for the services you chose to support. If you chose to support XQuery services, you'll be prompted for how many USD you want to charge for access to XQuery. If you chose to support Hydra services, you'll be prompted for how many USD you want to charge for access to Hydra services at tier1 and tier2 levels. (You won't be prompted for tier2 level pricing if you didn't elect to support ETH because tier2 level only applies when ETH is supported.) The USD amounts you enter are what your SNode will charge for 6,000,000 API calls. Pricing in terms of 6,000,000 API calls makes it convenient to compare your pricing with that of other similar services. Default values are recommended. See Hydra/XQuery Projects API for definitions of tier1 and tier2 service levels. Note: Entering 0 for any of the USD amounts you're prompted for will allow clients of your SNode to create projects which have 10,000 free API calls to the service(s) for which you are charging 0 USD. Next, you'll be prompted to enter the discount percentages you want to offer clients for payments in aBLOCK, aaBLOCK or sysBLOCK. These payment discounts are relative to the US dollar amounts entered in the previous step. The idea of giving discounts to clients paying with aBLOCK, aaBLOCK or sysBLOCK comes from the idea that we want to encourage payment in various forms of BLOCK in order to increase demand for BLOCK. Due to high eth gas fees currently associated with paying in aBLOCK, the default discount for aBLOCK is currently set at 20%. Default values are recommended for all discounts. Next, you'll be asked if you want to support UTXO_PLUGIN service. Supporting this service requires about 32 GB RAM, 8 CPU cores and 200 GB of disk space. It doesn't yet offer any financial reward, though a system of rewards for supporting it is planned. Supporting this service does help to make XLite more reliable by increasing the number of data sources from which XLite can achieve an XRouter consensus response when fetching data for the chains it supports. Next, you'll be asked, \" Do you wish to change install locations? \" Type \" y \" here if you want to change the data mount directory of any service from /snode to some other directory. This option can be useful if, for example, you have a separate, very large, fast disk dedicated to supporting ETH, a service which requires large, fast NVMe SSD storage. Selecting \" y \" here will display a selection menu which displays the current data mount directory for each service and allows you to select the services for which you want to change the data mount directory . The selection menu will look something like the following: Next, a storage space calculations table will be displayed which can help you confirm that your server's storage space resources are capable of supporting all the services you've elected to support. The table will look something like this: On analyzing this table, if you determine that your server's storage space resources are not capable of supporting all the services you've elected to support, issue Control-C to stop the configuration process, then run ./builder.py (or ./exr_env.sh --builder \"\" ) again. There are 6 columns in the storage space calculations table: Directory : This column displays the directory in which the data for the service will be stored, called the data mount directory . Available : This column displays the available disk space in the data mount directory of the service. Required : This column displays the approximate space required to host the blockchain of the service. Existing dir : If a previously synced blockchain of the service was found in the data mount directory of the service, this column displays the subdirectory in which the synced blockchain was found (e.g. BTC , LTC ) and size of that synced blockchain (e.g. 456.64 GB , 76.95 GB ). If none was found, it displays no subdirectory and 0 GB for size. Checks : This column displays a green PASS if the data mount directory of the service has enough space to host the service. Otherwise, it displays a red WARNING . Note: A WARNING message in the Checks column should only be ignored if you are certain the value displayed in the Required column is too large/not accurate, and you have carefully calculated that all your selected services will actually fit on the selected data mount directories of your system. Requirement Calculations : This column displays the calculations performed to determine if green PASS or red WARNING should be displayed in the Checks column. If the calculation, \" Available - ( Required - Existing dir )\" yields a positive number, PASS is displayed; Otherwise, WARNING is displayed. At the bottom of the storage space calculations table is a row titled, TOTAL , which gives a cumulative summary of all the rows above. Finally, you'll be given the option to use a unique auto-generated file name, or a user-specified file name for storing the SNode configuration information you've entered. If, for example, you enter the file name latest then a file containing your SNode configuration will be generated in the inputs_yaml directory, and the file will be named, latest.yaml (i.e. your SNode config will be stored as inputs_yaml/latest.yaml ). (Informational) In addition to being stored in the .yaml format mentioned in the previous step, your SNode configuration will also be stored in a processed form in the file, docker-compose.yml . docker-compose.yml will then be used by the ./deploy.sh script when you're ready to deploy your Service Node. Note for advanced users: If you ever want to manually modify the .yaml file mentioned in the previous step, then use your modified .yaml file to generate a new docker-compose.yml file, you can do so using the --yaml parameter like this: ./builder.py --yaml inputs_yaml/latest.yaml Before you deploy your Service Node, you may want to review the SNode config file generated by builder.py (e.g. inputs_yaml/latest.yaml ) to confirm that everything is configured as intended. For example, you may want to review the data mount directory ( data_mount_dir ) for the services which require large amounts of disk space to confirm the specified data_mount_dir has enough disk space available to support the service. If the configuration looks good, you can launch your Service Node by issuing the following command: ./deploy.sh Tip: If you pass the --deploy parameter to ./builder.py , it will automatically call ./deploy.sh after it finishes generating the SNode configuration files. Examples: ./builder.py --deploy ./exr_env.sh --builder \"--deploy\" Most likely you won't need to follow the remaining steps below if you have followed them previously and you're simply reconfiguring your SNode on this run. However, if your SNode has been offline for a while, you may need to reregister it as per steps 26-30 below. You can check if your SNode needs to be reregistered by following steps 29 & 30 below. Didn't see an option to support the service or coin you want to support? Options to support more services/coins are continuously being added. The goal is that Service Nodes will have an option to support every coin supported by BlockDX , which means every coin listed in Blocknet manifest-latest.json . Service Nodes will also soon have the option to support a wide variety of EVM blockchains, like Ethereum/ETH, Avalanche/AVAX, Binance Smart Chain/BSC, Fantom/FTM, Solana/SOL, Polkadot/DOT, Cardano/ADA, etc. Tip: How to Reset Configuration Defaults. builder.py remembers previous SNode configuration choices. Usually this is quite handy and desirable, but sometimes it's useful to make it forget previous configuration choices. There are 5 files builder.py uses to remember previous configuration choices made by the user: .env , .known_hosts , .known_volumes , .cache and .cache_ip . If you want to reset any of the default values builder.py presents to you during the configuration process, deleting (or renaming) one or more of these files before running ./builder.py will likely do the trick. You can also reset all of these files at once like this: ./builder.py --prunecache .env - remembers your Public IP address, Service Node Name, Service Node Private Key, Service Node Address, RPC User and RPC Password. .known_hosts - remembers the IP addresses of any externally hosted EVM chains. .known_volumes - remembers any special data mount directories you chose for specific services. .cache - remembers choices you made about which services to support, and how to set up payments .cache_ip - remembers the IP addresses assigned to docker containers on the last deployment (so it can try to assign the same IP addresses again if they are available). Warning: Only expose Hasura GUI XQuery port to restricted hosts, if ever. \u00b6 Warning: Only expose Hasura GUI XQuery port to restricted hosts, if ever. It is a security risk to leave Hasura GUI Console port exposed to all hosts. By default, this port is not exposed to outside hosts. However, there may be occassions when an advanced SNode operator wants to expose the Hasura GUI Console port to a select set of outside hosts for a time. For example, it could be useful to allow a client to design an SQL query to the XQuery service on your SNode using the convenient Hasura graphical SQL query interface. See XQuery Hasura GUI Console for instructions on how to view the XQuery Hasura GUI Console in a browser. If you want to expose the Hasura GUI Console port on your SNode, edit the following section in docker-compose.yml just before you run ./deploy.sh : xquery-graphql-engine: image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.0.10 hostname: graphql-engine #ports: # - \"8080:8080\" Uncomment the last two lines of this section, like this xquery-graphql-engine: image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.0.10 hostname: graphql-engine ports: - \"8080:8080\" To restrict access to port 8080 to a limited set of hosts, you can use uncomplicated firewall (ufw) If you are trying to add Service Node support for a new coin which is not yet listed in Blocknet manifest-latest.json configuration file, please refer to the Listing Process for general information on listing a new coin. Then, to add support for the new coin on your Service Node, follow this procedure: Add Support for a New Coin or a New Config of a Coin. Make a copy of autobuild/sources.yaml . For example: cp autobuild/sources.yaml autobuild/custom.yaml Use a simple editor like vi or nano , to edit the copy you just made. For Example: vi autobuild/custom.yaml In the editor, duplicate the entry for some common coin (e.g. LTC), then modify the duplicate entry so that it references the name and docker image of the new coin you want to support. Save the file and exit the editor. Run ./builder.py , passing it two parameters: One to specify the file you just edited as the source of available coins/services, and one to instruct it to reference a configuration repository which contains configuration data for the new coin. For example: ./builder.py --source autobuild/custom.yaml --branchpath https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConanMishler/blockchain-configuration-files/bitcoin--v0.22.0.conf NOTE: The URL passed via the --branchpath parameter must be in raw form, as in the example above. Launch your SNode by issuing the following command: ./deploy.sh Advanced users may want to deploy a Testnet SNode , a Trading Node , or a Testnet Trading Node instead of a regular SNode . These 3 special kinds of nodes are defined here . Deploy a Testnet SNode , a Trading Node , or a Testnet Trading Node . Make a copy of autobuild/sources.yaml . For example: cp autobuild/sources.yaml autobuild/custom.yaml Use a simple editor like vi or nano , to edit the copy you just made. For Example: vi autobuild/custom.yaml In the editor, search for the following text - name: SNODE then change SNODE to one of the following, depending which type of node you want to deploy: testSNODE TNODE testTNODE Save the file and exit the editor. Run ./builder.py , passing it a parameter to specify the file you just edited as the source of available coins/services. For example: ./builder.py --source autobuild/custom.yaml Launch your node by issuing the following command: ./deploy.sh (Recommended for servers with less than 32 GB RAM or less than 10 CPU cores.) If your server HW resources are somewhat limited, it is recommended to deploy certain SNode services in stages. The reason is because some services are known to require large amounts of RAM and/or I/O bandwidth while they are syncing their respective blockchains. ETH, AVAX, LBC and DGB all fall into this category. For this reason, it is recommended not to run more than one of those 4 while any one of them is syncing on a server with limited HW resources. For example, it's best not to run LBC or DGB while AVAX is syncing, or to run AVAX or DGB while LBC is syncing. To deploy SNode services in stages, simply limit which services you select to support the first time you run ./builder.py , then run ./builder.py again after the resource intensive blockchain(s) have synced, this time selecting additional services to support. (Informational) Once your SNode is configured and deployed, you should see the scripts do their magic and launch docker containers for all the services you configured your Service Node to support. You can see all the running docker containers by issuing the command: docker ps This command will display the CONTAINER ID, the IMAGE used to build it, the COMMAND running in the container, when it was CREATED, its current STATUS, which PORTS it uses, and any NAMES assigned to it. To complete the Service Node deployment, we'll need to know either the CONTAINER ID or container NAME of the Service Node container. For that, we can filter the above docker ps output through grep like this: docker ps | grep snode That command should return information about the snode container, something like this: f9b910221ca2 blocknetdx/servicenode:latest \"/opt/blockchain/sta\u2026\" 26 hours ago Up 26 hours 41412/tcp, 41414/tcp, 41419/tcp, 41474/tcp exrproxy-env-snode-1 The first item returned in this example ( f9b910221ca2 ) is the CONTAINER ID, and the last item returned ( exrproxy-env-snode-1 ) is the NAME of the container. Either of these two values can be used to access the snode container. It will take 3.5+ hours for the Blocknet blockchain to sync in your snode container. Periodically monitor the current block height of the Blocknet wallet running in the snode container by issuing the following command: docker exec exrproxy-env-snode-1 blocknet-cli getblockcount Note, here we are executing the command, blocknet-cli within the exrproxy-env-snode-1 container, which is the name we found for the snode container in the previous step. Also note, initial calls to getblockcount may return errors until headers finish syncing. This is normal and nothing to be concerned about. Tips for monitoring block height during syncing, and generally accessing blocknet-cli more easily. To make access to the blocknet-cli program more convenient, you may want to create an alias something like the following: alias snode-cli='docker exec exrproxy-env-snode-1 blocknet-cli' If you add that alias to ~/.bash_aliases (or any file sourced on login), it will be defined automatically every time you login to your Linux system. Another idea is to create a small Bash Shell script something like this: #!/bin/bash docker exec exrproxy-env-snode-1 blocknet-cli $* If you create such a shell script, give it a name like snode-cli , give it executable permissions ( chmod +x snode-cli ), then move it to some directory in your $PATH , then you can use the Linux watch utility like this: watch snode-cli getblockcount (Enter echo $PATH to see which directories are in your $PATH . Enter man watch to learn about the watch utility and its options.) When the block height in the snode container matches that of the Blocknet blockchain explorer , your Service Node wallet is fully synced and you can now activate your Service Node as follows: On your Collateral Wallet , issue the command, servicenoderegister . If your Collateral Wallet was set up according to the VPS Staking guide , and the alias for blocknet-cli was also created according to that guide, you can issue the servicenoderegister command as follows: blocknet-cli servicenoderegister Otherwise, if your Collateral Wallet is a GUI/Qt wallet running on a different computer, simply enter servicenoderegister in Tools->Debug Console of your Collateral Wallet . On your Service Node Wallet , issue the servicenodesendping command like this: docker exec exrproxy-env-snode-1 blocknet-cli servicenodesendping (Note, if you created the snode-cli alias or shell script as suggested in the Tip above, you can enter simply, snode-cli servicenodesendping .) On your Service Node Wallet , check to confirm your Service Node is running and supporting all the right coins/services, like this: docker exec exrproxy-env-snode-1 blocknet-cli servicenodestatus This command should return \"status\": \"running\", and also the corrrect/expected list of supported services. You can also verify your Service Node is visible on the network by issuing the following command on your Collateral Wallet : blocknet-cli servicenodestatus (If your Collateral Wallet is a GUI/Qt wallet, simply enter servicenodestatus in Tools->Debug Console of your Collateral Wallet .) (Recommended) Install fail2ban to protect your EXR SNode from malicious http attacks. The following steps are for setting up fail2ban v0.11.1-1 on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS . The steps for setting up other versions of fail2ban should be very similar, but they may not be exactly the same. Install fail2ban Get the xr_proxy-log-path : docker inspect exrproxy-env-xr_proxy-1 | grep '\"LogPath\":' This will return something like the following: \"LogPath\": \"/var/lib/docker/containers/6554ded0f7dd2abc0f415a511ff0099c5233fca6e17f2b409e9f40be4d43d9cf/6554ded0f7dd2abc0f415a511ff0099c5233fca6e17f2b409e9f40be4d43d9cf-json.log\", The /var/lib/docker/containers/<big-hex-number>-json.log part of what's returned is the xr_proxy-log-path we'll need in future steps, so copy it someplace for future use. Find your LAN address range. Your LAN address range can be found by issuing this command: ip addr The ip addr command will return something like this: 1: lo: mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000 link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00 inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 ::1/128 scope host valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever 2: wlp58s0: mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether 9c:b6:d0:d0:fc:b5 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 192.168.1.20/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlp58s0 valid_lft 5962sec preferred_lft 5962sec inet6 fe80::bf14:21e3:4223:e5e4/64 scope link noprefixroute valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever In the above output, you can ignore item 1: called lo (loopback). You can see that the IP address range of the LAN in this example is displayed in item 2: just after the word, inet : 192.168.1.20/24 . The /24 at the end tells us that the first 24 bits of this address define the range of the LAN's subnet mask . 192.168.1.20/24 then represents the full range of addresses used by the LAN in this example system. Copy whatever value represents the full range of the LAN for your system. We'll need it in a future step. Intall fail2ban : sudo apt install fail2ban Initialize setup sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local Edit config file: Use a simple text editor like vi or nano to edit /etc/fail2ban/jail.local . For example: sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local Within /etc/fail2ban/jail.local , search for these 3 commented out lines: #bantime.increment = true #bantime.factor = 1 #bantime.formula = ban.Time * (1<<(ban.Count if ban.Count<20 else 20)) * banFactor Note, these 3 lines will be in different parts of the file, not contiguous as they are displayed above. Uncomment those 3 line by removing the # at the beginning of each line: bantime.increment = true bantime.factor = 1 bantime.formula = ban.Time * (1<<(ban.Count if ban.Count<20 else 20)) * banFactor Search for the following line #ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1 Uncomment this line by removing the # at the begginning of the line so it looks like this: ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1 It will also be good to add the full address range of your LAN, as discovered above in step b , to the end of this line. This will whitelist all the IP addresses of your LAN so they can't get banned. For example, to whitelist all LAN addresses for the example system of step b above, you would simply add a space and then 192.168.1.20/24 to the end of the ipignore line, like this: ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1 192.168.1.20/24 (Be sure to replace 192.168.1.20/24 here with whatever LAN address range you discovered for your system in step b above.) Search for the following line: banaction = iptables-multiport Change it to: banaction = iptables-allports Search for these 3 lines: # # JAILS # Just below those 3 lines, add the following lines, replacing xr_proxy-log-path with the xr_proxy-log-path you found in step a above: [nginx-x00] enabled = true port = http,https filter = nginx-x00 logpath = xr_proxy-log-path maxretry = 1 findtime = 3600 bantime = 24h [nginx-404] enabled = true port = http,https filter = nginx-404 logpath = xr_proxy-log-path maxretry = 1 findtime = 3600 bantime = 1h After replacing xr_proxy-log-path with the value you found in step a above, the logpath = lines will look something like this: logpath = /var/lib/docker/containers/<big-hex-number>-json.log Save your edits to /etc/fail2ban/jail.local and exit the editor. Add Filters: Use a simple text editor like vi or nano to create the file, /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-x00.conf . For example: sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-x00.conf Add the following lines to the file: [Definition] failregex = ^{\"log\":\"<HOST> .* .*\\\\x ignoreregex = Then save the file and exit the editor. Use a simple text editor like vi or nano to create the file, /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-404.conf . For example: sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-404.conf Add the following lines to the file: [Definition] failregex = {\"log\":\"<HOST>.*(GET|POST|HEAD).*( 404 ) ignoreregex = Then save the file and exit the editor. Restart fail2ban service: sudo service fail2ban restart Verify fail2ban is running properly: sudo service fail2ban status Check the logs of fail2ban : sudo tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log (Ctrl-C to exit scrolling logs.) Fix iptables. To complete this last step, you must wait for at least one IP address to get banned in each of the two jails we created above ( nginx-x00 and nginx-404 ). This may take a few hours, so you may want to just let fail2ban run overnight before coming back to this step. Then check the fail2ban logs to confirm there has been at least one IP banned in each of the new jails: sudo less /var/log/fail2ban.log Search with less for nginx-404 and nginx-x00 to confirm at least one IP ban in each jail. Once this has been confirmed, you can fix the system IP tables so the fail2ban logs will no longer print the \"Already Banned\" messages. Fix the IP tables by issuing these two commands: sudo iptables -I FORWARD -j f2b-nginx-x00 sudo iptables -I FORWARD -j f2b-nginx-404 To learn how to add or subtract supported services/coins from your Service Node, and generally navigate and manage the docker containers of your Service Node, continue on to Maintenance of Enterprise XRouter Environment Maintenance of Enterprise XRouter Environment \u00b6 Maintenance of Enterprise XRouter Environment Changing Configuration of an Enterprise XRouter Environment With the advent of the builder.py script, the procedure for changing the configuration of an EXR ENV is basically the same as it is for configuring and deploying an EXR ENV for the first time. That procedure is given in the first 21 steps of the Deploy Enterprise XRouter Environment guide. Note, however, if you've subtracted one or more services/coins from your EXR ENV's supported services because you want to save the disk space occupied by those services/coins, please remember that the blockchain data is not deleted/removed when the docker container of a service is removed by builder.py . The blockchain data of a service/coin persists in the data mount directory you chose for the service when configuring your SNode. If you kept the default data mount directory , which is /snode , then the blockchain data for DGB, for example, will be stored in /snode/DGB , and it can occupy many GB of space. To find out exactly how much space is being used by each service/coin, you can enter: sudo du -d 1 -h /snode which will return something like this: 57G /snode/LTC 3.6G /snode/MONA 222M /snode/testsnode 3.3G /snode/snode 27G /snode/DGB 16K /snode/xr_proxy 11G /snode/RVN 48M /snode/eth_pymt_db Sudo is necessary here because /snode directory is owned by root , not by $USER. So, if you want to stop supporting DGB coin, for example, and you also want to free up the 27GB of space the DGB blockchain is occupying, you'll need to first use ./builder.py to reconfigure and relaunch your SNode without DGB support, then issue the following command to permanently remove DGB blockchain data and free the space it is occupying: sudo rm -rf /snode/DGB Warning: If you've been running a Trading Node on your EXR ENV server, be sure to save any wallet files which may be located in the data mount directory before issuing the the rm -rf command to remove the data mount directory . Warning: Be very careful to enter the rm -rf command very precisely. A typo could be disastrous. Also, be aware that adding support for DGB again after deleting its blockchain data will require the DGB blockchain to sync from scratch. About docker Tip: If the blockchain of one of the services in your EXR ENV gets onto a fork, or gets its database corrupted, often the easiest way to get it back on track is to stop the docker container running the service, then remove data mount directory of the service, then start the service again. You can use ./builder.py to stop the docker container running the service, or you can stop the container manually. For example, to manually stop the DGB container, you would issue this command: docker stop exrproxy-env-DGB-1 Then you could remove the data mount directory like this: sudo rm -rf /snode/DGB Then start the container again like this: docker start exrproxy-env-DGB-1 Warning: If you've been running a Trading Node on your EXR ENV server, be sure to save any wallet files which may be located in the data mount directory before issuing the the rm -rf command to remove the data mount directory . For the most part, the docker commands given thus far in this guide will suffice to manage your EXR ENV . However, if something \"out of the ordinary\" happens, or if you want to do something fancy with your docker objects, there are a few more things it will be good to know about docker: Let's say, for example, you want to interact directly with the DGB daemon, but you aren't sure the name of the DGB CLI executable command. Here's one way to find it: Start an interactive Bash shell in the DGB container: docker exec -it exrproxy-env-DGB-1 /bin/bash You should see a prompt like this: root@f4c21d83d6fe:/opt/blockchain# Find which daemons are running in the DGB container: root@f4c21d83d6fe:/opt/blockchain# ps uax It should show you something like this: USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND root 1 46.4 28.7 8132896 4726660 ? SLsl 11:37 25:38 digibyted -conf=/opt/blockchain/config/digibyte.conf root 29 1.7 0.0 18248 3280 pts/0 Ss 12:33 0:00 /bin/bash root 39 0.0 0.0 34424 2788 pts/0 R+ 12:33 0:00 ps uax Note there is one running process called, digibyted . This is the name of the Digibyte daemon process and it is also a great clue about the name of the CLI command for interacting with the Digibyte daemon. The name of the CLI command can usually be derived from the name of the daemon process by simply replacing the d at the end of the daemon process with -cli , like this: digibyted -> digibyte-cli If you want to verify there is a digibyte-cli command, you can do this: which digibyte-cli which should return this: /usr/bin/digibyte-cli Now you can interact with the Digibyte daemon as follows: root@f4c21d83d6fe:/opt/blockchain# digibyte-cli getblockcount 13535747 Alternatively, we can exit the Bash shell running in the DGB container, then execute the digibyte-cli command from outside the docker container: root@f4c21d83d6fe:/opt/blockchain# exit exit ~$ docker exec exrproxy-env-DGB-1 digibyte-cli getblockcount 13535762 Now let's consider the case where the docker container with which you want to interact does not have Bash shell available. This is [edit: was ] the case for the Syscoin container, for example. Attempting to invoke the Bash shell in the Syscoin container will result in an error: docker exec -it exrproxy-env-SYS-1 /bin/bash OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: exec: \"/bin/bash\": stat /bin/bash: no such file or directory: unknown The solution is to invoke a shell which does exist in the container, like this: docker exec -it exrproxy-env-SYS-1 /bin/sh Another unique feature of [an earlier version of] the Syscoin container is that the syscoin-cli command requires certain parameters to be passed to it in order to work properly. For example: docker exec exrproxy-env-SYS-1 syscoin-cli getblockcount returns error: Could not locate RPC credentials. No authentication cookie could be found, and RPC password is not set. See -rpcpassword and -stdinrpcpass. Configuration file: (/root/.syscoin/syscoin.conf) But invoking syscoin-cli as follows, works properly: docker exec exrproxy-env-SYS-1 syscoin-cli -conf=/opt/blockchain/config/syscoin.conf getblockcount 1218725 Alternatively, this also works: docker exec exrproxy-env-SYS-1 syscoin-cli -datadir=/opt/blockchain/config getblockcount 1218725 Note: The DASH container, and perhaps other containers, will also require these same parameters to be passed to the CLI command. [edit: The latest SYS container does not require the additional parameter] Now let's consider another case where more docker knowledge could be required. Let's consider the case where you try to manually stop and remove all the docker containers of your SNode using docker-compose down in the ~/exrproxy-env directory. Consider the example where docker-compose down fails to complete due to receiving a timeout error something like the following: UnixHTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=None): Read timed out. Some users have actually seen this exact error when trying to run docker-compose down while an I/O intensive process (e.g. lbrycrdd ) is running on the system. Here are some potentially helpful suggestions on how to fix/avoid this timeout error . However, once docker-compose down has failed to complete even once, it can leave your docker environment in a state where some docker containers have been stopped , but have not yet been removed. This state is problematic because your next attempt to bring up your EXR ENV with deploy.sh will give errors saying the container names you're trying to create, already exist. If you suspect such a situation has developed, one thing you can do is to list all docker containers - both running and stopped: docker ps -a If this command shows some containers with a stopped STATUS, then you probably need to remove those stopped containers. Fortunately, docker has a handy prune utility for removing all stopped containers: docker container prune Also, if your docker containers, images, volumes and/or networks get messed up for any reason, or if you end up with docker images on your server which are no longer used and taking up space unnecessarily, docker offers a variety of prune utilities to clean up the current state of your docker environment . Note: In the context of an EXR ENV , executing the following 2 command should be equivalent to docker-compose down : docker stop $(docker ps -q -f name=exrproxy-env_*) docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f name=exrproxy-env_*) This trick can be useful, for example, if docker-compose.yml is accidentally reconfigured before docker-compose down is executed, causing docker-compose down to fail. docker offers a variety of useful utilities for managing and interacting with various docker objects.

Minimum System Probably the minumum HW requirements for any Service Node would be: 4 CPU cores (or 4 vCPUs if the Service Node runs on a VPS) 8 GB RAM 200 GB SSD Storage (doubtful that slower, HDD drives would work). 25+MBit/s Internet download speed. (100+ MBit/s is much better for faster syncing.) Such a system could support a few small SPV wallets and a Blocknet staking wallet. Medium & Large Systems If you want to host the Hydra and/or XQuery Indexer services (and maybe a few SPV wallets as well), you'll likely need at least 10 vCPUs, 60 GB of RAM and 1.3 TB+ of SSD storage space. Hosting Hydra or XQuery services requires hosting an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain like Ethereum/ETH, Avalanche/AVAX, Sys NEVM, Binance Smart Chain/BSC, Fantom/FTM, Solana/SOL, Polkadot/DOT, Cardano/ADA, etc. So far, testing of XQuery suggests it should be possible to host XQuery services supporting EVMs like AVAX, Sys NEVM & BSC on HW with these same specs, though it may be necessary to add extra storage to support the rapidly growing AVAX blockchain. Minumum HW requirements for a medium to large Service Node capable of supporting Hydra and/or XQuery Indexer services would be something like this: 10 CPU cores (or 10 vCPUs if the Service Node runs on a VPS) 60 GB RAM 1.3+ TB SSD Storage 25+MBit/s Internet download speed (100+ MBit/s is much better for faster syncing.)

A Google search for \"VPS Hosting Service Provider\" will show many more options. As of this writing, Contabo seems to offer the most hardware for the money, but it's always good to do a little comparison shopping. Extra Large System for supporting ETH archival node To support Hydra and/or XQuery Indexer services of the Ethereum/ETH blockchain, a Service Node must host an ETH archival node. In terms of CPU and RAM requirements, running an ETH archival node requires: 8 CPU Cores (or 8 vCPUs if the ETH archival Node runs on a VPS) 16 GB RAM The storage space requirements for an ETH archival node are a bit more demanding. The Go-Ethereum (GETH) archival node, which is the core wallet needed to run an ETH archival node, occupies about 8TB of space as of this writing (July 17, 2021). Furthermore, it is growing by 3TB per year. (Its current size can be found here .) Therefore, a Service Node supporting an ETH archival node should probably have at least 10TB for ETH alone, plus maybe another 1.5-2TB for running other SPV wallets. It should also have the ability to expand its storage space by 3TB per year. Update Sept. 27, 2021: Some Blocknet community members are researching the possibility of using the Erigon ETH archival node instead of the Go ETH (GETH) archival node. This is promising research as the Erigon ETH archival node occupies only about a quarter of the space of the GETH archival node. In other words, only about 2TB instead of 8TB as of this writing. Erigon ETH archival node also syncs in about one quarter the time it takes GETH to sync. As of this writing, it appears Erigon ETH may well be able to support Hydra services of ETH in its current stage of development, but until Erigon has standard ETH filter methods, it won't support XQuery services of ETH. Please join discussions in the #hydra channel of Blocknet Discord to keep up with the latest developments on Erigon ETH. It's also important to note that the storage for the ETH full archival node must be very fast. In other words, it must use SSDs, not HDDs. There are 3 types of SSDs: SATA, SAS and NVMe/PCIe. Of the 3, SATA are the slowest, SAS are a little faster, and NVMe are by far the fastest. NVMe are definitely the preferred variety of SSD drive when it comes to hosting an ETH archival node. In fact, it looks doubtful that SATA or SAS SSD drives will be fast enough to allow the ETH node to sync. It is also recommended that the SSDs used for an ETH archival node be configured in a RAID mirror configuration (e.g. RAID-1, RAID-10, RAID-Z2). Without RAID mirroring, an SSD failure will almost certainly mean you'll have to resync the entire ETH full archival node, which takes over a month for a GETH node (but probably only a quarter of that time for an Erigon ETH node). Your ETH archival node will be offline for the duration of the resync. As of this writing, it's not clear that any of the VPS Provider Options mentioned above are capable of providing a VPS which meets the HW requirements for an ETH archival node, or if they are capable, the cost can be a bit extreme and it's not clear they can expand storage space as needed to support the growing ETH full archival node. There may well be some smaller VPS providers who are capable of both meeting current HW requirements and allowing for storage space expansion in the future. There are also efforts underway to coordinate \"package discounts\" from such VPS provider(s) for a person or group of people to rent a number of ETH archival-capable VPS's at a discounted rate. Please join discussions on this topic in the #hydra channel of Blocknet Discord . Another option for meeting the HW requirements of an ETH archival node is to purchase your own hardware and run it at home or in a colocation hosting data center. (Colocation hosting services can be found for USD $50 per month per server, as of Feb., 2022.) If purchasing your own SSD drives, be aware that ETH core will be writing to your SSDs continuously, so you'll want to get SSDs with a high \"durability\" rating. For example, a company called Sabrent offers an 8TB NVMe SSD. On the surface, it may look like a good choice to use for building a system with lots of fast storage space. Unfortunately, this particular drive only has a TBW (Total Bytes Written) durability rating of 1,800 TB TBW, which, according to this review makes it not very suitable to be used in an application that writes to it frequently. (Note, Samsung NVMe drives and/or any NVMe drives rated for industrial use are probably quite durable and suitable for supporting an archival ETH node.)

Do this before setting up your Service Node. Service Node operators will often want to run a Collateral Wallet or a Staking Wallet on the same computer as their Service Node Wallet . In almost all cases, the Collateral Wallet will also be staking , so we can say it is also a Staking Wallet . A Staking Wallet , however, is not always used as a Collateral Wallet . To run a Staking Wallet and a Service Node Wallet on the same computer, follow these steps: Set up your Staking Wallet . Here is an example guide for setting up a Staking Wallet on a VPS running Ubuntu Linux . The Hardware Requirements for a Service Node Wallet should be followed when selecting a VPS as per that guide. Stop your Staking Wallet . If your Staking Wallet has been set up according to the VPS Staking guide , and the alias for blocknet-cli has also been set up according to that guide, you can stop your Staking Wallet by issuing the follow command: blocknet-cli stop Change the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) port and the RPC port of your Staking Wallet so they don't conflict with the P2P port and the RPC port of your Service Node Wallet . To do this on a Linux system, Change directory to your Staking Wallet data directory. If your Staking Wallet has been set up according to the VPS Staking guide , your Staking Wallet data directory will be ~/.blocknet . For Example: cd ~/.blocknet Use a simple text editor like vi or nano to edit the wallet configuration file, blocknet.conf . For Example: nano blocknet.conf Note, editing blocknet.conf will create blocknet.conf if it doesn't already exist. Add two lines like the following to your blocknet.conf : port=41413 rpcport=41415 Note: The port and rpcport values you set in your blocknet.conf don't have to be 41413 and 41415, as in the example above; they just have to be port numbers which are not used as either port or rpcport in the default Blocknet wallet configuration. Therefore you must not use 41412 or 41414, which are the default values for port and rpcport , respectively. You should also not use the default port or rpcport values for Blocknet testnet, which are 41474 and 41419, respectively. Incrementing the default Blocknet port and rpcport values by 1, as in the example above, is a pretty safe strategy for avoiding potential port conflicts. Not only does this avoid potential port conflicts with the Blocknet testnet, but also with other SPV wallets running on your Service Node. Save your edits to blocknet.conf , exit the editor and restart your Staking Wallet . If your Staking Wallet has been set up according to the VPS Staking guide , and the aliases for blocknet-cli , blocknet-daemon and blocknet-unlock have also been set up according to that guide, you can restart your Staking Wallet and start it staking again by issuing the follow commands: blocknet-daemon (You'll need to wait a few minutes after starting the Blocknet daemon for your wallet to sync the headers. Then you'll be allowed to unlock your wallet for staking in the next step.) Unlock your staking wallet for staking only: blocknet-unlock (Enter your wallet password when prompted.) Confirm your wallet is staking by issuing the command: blocknet-cli getstakingstatus When this command returns, \"status\": \"Staking is active\" , then you know your wallet is staking properly. Note, you may also want to confirm your staking wallet balance is correct with: blocknet-cli getbalance If you will be setting up your Service Node following the Enterprise XRouter Environment Service Node Setup Guide , there is nothing more you need to do regarding your Staking Wallet and you can proceed directly to the Enterprise XRouter Environment Service Node Setup Guide . However, if you will be setting up your Service Node following the Manual Service Node Setup Guide , you'll need to move your Staking Wallet data directory to allow the Service Node Wallet data directory to occupy the default data directory location . To move your Staking Wallet data directory, follow these steps: Stop your Staking Wallet . If your Staking Wallet has been set up according to the VPS Staking guide , and the alias for blocknet-cli has also been set up according to that guide, you can stop your Staking Wallet with: blocknet-cli stop Wait till your Staking Wallet stops completely. You can monitor the Staking Wallet Linux process (called blocknetd ) by repeatedly pasting/issuing the following command: ps x -o args | grep -v \"grep\" | grep \"blocknetd\" Before the Staking Wallet Linux process has stopped completely, that command will return something like this: /home/[user]/blocknet-4.3.3/bin/blocknetd -daemon Continue issuing that ps x -o args command until it returns nothing. Then you know the blocknetd process has stopped completely and it's safe to move your data directory. Issue the following commands to move (rename) your Staking Wallet data directory: cd ~ mv .blocknet .blocknet_staking Now, assuming your Staking Wallet access aliases have been set up according to the VPS Staking guide , you'll need to change those alias definitions to reflect the fact that your Staking Wallet data directory has changed. To do so, use vi or nano to edit the ~/.bash_aliases file. For Example: nano ~/.bash_aliases Leave the first line of the file as it is: export BLOCKNET_VERSION='4.3.3' With 4.3.3 being replaced by whatever version of Blocknet wallet your Staking Wallet is running. Then change all the alias definitions to be as follows: export BLOCKNET_VERSION='4.3.3' # blocknet-daemon = Start Blocknet daemon for staking wallet alias blocknet-daemon='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknetd -daemon -datadir=$HOME/.blocknet_staking/' # blocknet-cli = Staking wallet Command Line Interface alias blocknet-cli='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknet-cli -datadir=$HOME/.blocknet_staking/' # blocknet-unlock = Unlock staking wallet for staking only alias blocknet-unlock='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknet-cli -datadir=$HOME/.blocknet_staking/ walletpassphrase \"$(read -sp \"Enter Password:\" undo; echo $undo;undo=)\" 9999999999 true' # blocknet-unlockfull = Unlock staking wallet fully alias blocknet-unlockfull='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknet-cli -datadir=$HOME/.blocknet_staking/ walletpassphrase \"$(read -sp \"Enter Password:\" undo; echo $undo;undo=)\" 9999999999 false' Save your edits to ~/.bash_aliases , exit the editor, then activate your new alias definitions with: source ~/.bash_aliases Restart your staking wallet with: blocknet-daemon Unlock your staking wallet for staking only: blocknet-unlock (Enter your wallet password when prompted.) Confirm your wallet is staking by issuing the command: blocknet-cli getstakingstatus When this command returns, \"status\": \"Staking is active\" , then you know your wallet is staking properly.

For example, here is a nice Quick Start Guide from Digital Ocean , and here is a guide from Contabo on connecting to your VPS . The first time you connect to your VPS, you'll be logged in as root user. Create a new user with the following command, replacing <username> with a username of your choice. adduser <username> You will be prompted for a password. Enter a password for <username> , different from your root password, and store it in a safe place. You will also see prompts for user information, but these can be left blank.

So, if you have 16 GB or RAM, you should create at least 16 GB of swap space. Many recommend creating twice as much swap space as you have RAM, which is a good idea if you can spare the disk space. However, more than 16 GB of swap space may not be required. To create swap space: Check if your system already has swap space allocated: swapon --show If the results of swapon --show look similar to this: swapon --show NAME TYPE SIZE USED PRIO /swapfile file 2G 0B -2 that means you already have some swap space allocated and you should follow this guide to allocate 1x-2x more swap space than you have GB of RAM. If the results of swapon --show do not indicate that your system has a swapfile of type file , you'll need to create a new swap file with 1x-2x more swap space than you have GB of RAM. To do so, follow this guide (Highly Recommended) Increase the security of your VPS by setting up SSH Keys to restrict access to your VPS from any computer other than your own . Those connecting via PuTTY from Windows should first follow this guide to set up SSH Keys with PuTTY .

There can be other inputs in the address which don't factor into this calculation, but it must be possible to add 10 or fewer inputs in the address to achieve a sum of >= 5000 BLOCK. If you want the address to qualify for 1 Superblock vote (recommended), you should create one small input to the address, ideally around 1 BLOCK in size, which is separate from the inputs used to meet the 5000 BLOCK requirement listed above. If you want the address to qualify for 1 Superblock vote (recommended), you should also ensure that the set of inputs used to meet the 5000 BLOCK requirement are all 100 BLOCK or larger in size. To fund a collateral address such that it meets these requirements, there are two options: Manual Funding or servicenodecreateinputs . Use one of these two options ( a or b ): Manual Funding: (recommended) Each time you send BLOCK to the collateral address, it creates an input to the address whose size is equal to the amount sent. So, to meet all the above requirements , you could send 1 BLOCK to the collateral address, then send BLOCK in amounts of >= 500 and <= 5000 BLOCK to the same collateral address until the sum of the >= 500 BLOCK inputs is >=5000. For example, you could send 1 BLOCK to the collateral address, then send 1250 BLOCK to the collateral address 4 times. After doing so, the collateral address would have 5 inputs : 1 input of 1 BLOCK and 4 inputs of 1250 BLOCK each. This would meet the above requirements . As another example, you could send 1 BLOCK to the collateral address, then send 5000 BLOCK to the same collateral address. That would leave the collateral address with 2 inputs : 1 input of 1 BLOCK and 1 input of 5000 BLOCK. This would also meet the above requirements . Note: If you are sending to the collateral address from the same wallet which contains the collateral address (and possibly other collateral addreses), it will be good to either lock the inputs of funds in collateral addresses , or send the funds using the Coin Controlled Sending feature to ensure the funds you're sending are not withdrawn from a collateral address you're trying to fund. It's easiest to perform coin controlled sending from the redesigned GUI/Qt wallet . However, if sending from a CLI wallet, you can use methods like createrawtransaction and sendrawtransaction to accomplish coin controlled sending. Get help on using these methods in the CLI wallet with: blocknet-cli help createrawtransaction and blocknet-cli help sendrawtransaction . Tip: Click here to learn how to see all inputs of a collateral address. In a redesigned GUI/Qt wallet : Select Window->Coin Control to display the addresses and Inputs where funds are stored in your wallet: This will display a screen like this ( in Tree mode ): On this screen you can click the small grey triangle to the left of an address to see the Inputs of the address. In a CLI wallet, or in Tools->Debug Console of the GUI/Qt wallet: Use the listunspent method to list all wallet Inputs and their associated addresses. From the CLI wallet: blocknet-cli listunspent From Tools->Debug Console of the GUI/Qt wallet: listunspent servicenodecreateinputs : servicenodecreateinputs is a method/tool of the Blocknet core wallet which can facillitate creating a set of inputs in a collateral address which meets the above requirements . Not only does it automatically create a set of inputs which meets the requirements , it also automatically creates a 1 block input to the collateral address to make the address eligible for voting . NOTE: If your wallet contains other collateral addresses which have already been funded, you'll want to lock the inputs of funds in all collateral addresses to prevent servicenodecreateinputs from withdrawing funds from other collateral addresses when it's called. NOTE: It is possible to use servicenodecreateinputs to set up collateral for multiple Service Nodes in a single collateral address. However, because this practice makes it difficult for tracking tools to associate collateral addresses with Service Nodes, the recommendation is to use a separate collateral address for each Service Node's collateral. Effectively, this means the recommendation is to always pass a NODE_COUNT parameter of 1 , or just leave the NODE_COUNT blank so it will default to 1 when calling servicenodecreateinputs . (See examples below.) To use the servicenodecreateinputs method/tool, your collateral wallet should contain at least 1 BLOCK to cover the transaction fee of calling the servicenodecreateinputs method, and at least 5001 BLOCK for each Service Node collateral you want to set up. Once those conditions are met, you can use the servicenodecreateinputs method like this: From Tools->Debug Console of the GUI/Qt wallet: servicenodecreateinputs NODE_ADDRESS NODE_COUNT INPUT_SIZE From the CLI wallet: blocknet-cli servicenodecreateinputs NODE_ADDRESS NODE_COUNT INPUT_SIZE In these examples, replace NODE_ADDRESS , NODE_COUNT and INPUT_SIZE with the desired values, as per the following definitions: NODE_ADDRESS = The collateral address created in step 1 above. NODE_COUNT = The number of Service Nodes for which to configure the collateral address. It is recommended to make this 1, or just leave it blank so it will default to 1. However, as mentioned, it is possible to configure a single collateral address to provide collateral for multiple Service Nodes. INPUT_SIZE = The amount of BLOCK for each input of the collateral address. Must be >= 500 and <= 5000 . If left blank, it defaults to 1250 . Example: 1000 will create 5 inputs of 1000 BLOCK each (per Service Node) Example which creates 4 inputs of 1250 BLOCK each in the collateral address, for a single Service Node : servicenodecreateinputs BmpZVb522wYmryYLDy6EckqGN4g8pT6tNP Example which creates 2 inputs of 2500 BLOCK each in the collateral address, for a single Service Node : servicenodecreateinputs BmpZVb522wYmryYLDy6EckqGN4g8pT6tNP 1 2500 Example which creates 2 inputs of 2500 BLOCK each in the collateral address for each of 4 Service Nodes servicenodecreateinputs BmpZVb522wYmryYLDy6EckqGN4g8pT6tNP 4 2500 This last example will result in 8 inputs of 2500 BLOCK each being created in the collateral address (plus a 1 BLOCK input for voting). Prepare to create (or add a new entry to) a servicenode.conf file in your data directory . If the servicenode.conf file does not exist in your data directory, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, review the contents of servicenode.conf in an editor. If all the service node references in the file are out-of-date, exit the editor and delete the file. If some service node references are current/valid, but others are out-of-date, delete all lines containing out-of-date service node references, save the file and exit the editor. Create (or add a new entry to) a servicenode.conf configuration file. Use the servicenodesetup command as follows: From Tools->Debug Console of the GUI/Qt wallet: servicenodesetup NODE_ADDRESS ALIAS From the CLI wallet: blocknet-cli servicenodesetup NODE_ADDRESS ALIAS Where NODE_ADDRESS is the collateral address you created in step 1 above, and ALIAS is any name you want to give to your Service Node (or group of Service Nodes). The ALIAS you choose here doesn't have to be the same as the ALIAS you chose for your collateral address in step 1, but it is usually most convenient to use the same ALIAS. The servicenodesetup command will create an entry for the Service Node(s) in the servicenode.conf file in your collateral wallet data directory . Example: servicenodesetup BmpZVb522wYmryYLDy6EckqGN4g8pT6tNP snode01 { \"alias\": \"snode01\", \"tier\": \"SPV\", \"snodekey\": \"02a5d0279e484a3df81acd611e1052d2e0797e796564ecbc25c7fe19f36e9985e5\", \"snodeprivkey\": \"PswGMd6faZf1ceLojzGeKn7LQuXVwYgRQG8obUKrThZ8ap4pkRR7\", \"address\": \"BmpZVb522wYmryYLDy6EckqGN4g8pT6tNP\" } Copy the snodeprivkey and the address returned in the previous step and paste them into a temporary text file. You'll need them later on. (In the above example, snodeprivkey is PswGMd6faZf1ceLojzGeKn7LQuXVwYgRQG8obUKrThZ8ap4pkRR7 , and address is BmpZVb522wYmryYLDy6EckqGN4g8pT6tNP ). Note, both the snodeprivkey and the address of your Service Node are also stored at this point in the servicenode.conf file in your collateral wallet data directory, so you can always find them there if you don't want to paste them into a temporary text file to record them. Restart the Collateral Wallet . For GUI/Qt wallet, simply close the Blocknet wallet application, then open it again. For CLI wallet (assuming aliases for blocknet-cli and blocknet-daemon have been set up according to the VPS Staking guide ): blocknet-cli stop blocknet-daemon Note, you will probably need to wait at least 30 seconds after issuing blocknet-cli stop or closing the GUI wallet app before you'll be allowed to relaunch blocknet-daemon or relaunch the GUI wallet. Just keep trying every 30 seconds or so to relaunch until you no longer get errors. Assuming you want to stake your collateral, unlock your staking wallet for staking only: For GUI/Qt wallet, unlock your wallet for staking only according to the staking guide for GUI wallet . For CLI wallet (assuming an alias for blocknet-unlock has been set up according to the VPS Staking guide ): blocknet-unlock (Enter your wallet password when prompted.) Confirm your wallet is staking with the getstakingstatus command. From Tools->Debug Console of the GUI/Qt wallet: getstakingstatus From the CLI wallet: blocknet-cli getstakingstatus When this command returns, \"status\": \"Staking is active\" , then you know your wallet is staking properly. Note, you may also want to confirm your staking wallet balance is correct with getbalance : From Tools->Debug Console of the GUI/Qt wallet: getbalance From the CLI wallet: blocknet-cli getbalance Continue on to Deploy Enterprise XRouter Environment .","title":"Collateral Address Requirements"},{"location":"service-nodes/setup/#deploy-enterprise-xrouter-environment","text":"Deploy Enterprise XRouter Environment Firstly, log in to the Ubuntu Linux server you set up above , (log in as the user you created, not as root), then continue with this guide.","title":"Deploy Enterprise XRouter Environment"},{"location":"service-nodes/setup/#run-global-install-script-for-enterprise-xrouter-environment","text":"If you have never run the Enterprise XRouter Environment (EXR ENV) Global Install script on this server, or if you have not run it since 1 Oct, 2022, copy/paste these commands to run the Global Install script: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blocknetdx/exrproxy-env-scripts/main/env_installer.sh -o env_installer.sh chmod +x env_installer.sh ./env_installer.sh --install If the Global Install Script detects docker/docker-compose is already installed, it simply won't install new version(s). If it detect the ~/exrproxy-env directory already exists, it will update it. If it detects ~/exrproxy-env does not already exist, it will clone it from the Github repository and thereby create it. IMPORTANT: This Global Install Script will log you out after it's finished with phase 1 of the install. This is necessary to update the user's membership in the docker group of Linux and to activate the python version control system ( pyenv ). Simply log in again after it logs you out, then issue the following command again to complete phase 2 of the install: ./env_installer.sh --install Then follow the steps below. Tip: How to Change Python Version. Since the Global Install Script installs the pyenv tool, it's very easy to change the version of python used in deploying the EXR ENV. The default python version set by the install script is 3.9.14. If, for example, you want to run the EXR ENV deployment scripts using python version 3.10.7, simply do this: cd ~/exrproxy-env pyenv install 3.10.7 pyenv local 3.10.7 Note, before you run the builder.py script in the steps below, confirm that you have ~/.local/bin in your $PATH variable. You can check this simply like this: echo $PATH If you don't see ~/.local/bin (or /home/<user-name>/.local/bin ) listed as one of the directories in your $PATH, take steps to ensure it gets added to your $PATH on every login. For example, if you're on a system where ~/.profile is sourced on every login, you could add these lines to ~/.profile : # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\" # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\" Then do this to add ~/.local/bin to your $PATH: source ~/.profile Prepare to enter all the details you'll need when you run the builder.py script: Most likely, builder.py will automatically find your server's public IP address, but it will be good to know your server's IP so you can verify (in a future step) that builder.py has found it correctly. Some options for fetching your Service Node computer's Public IP include: curl ipconfig.io curl ifconfig.co dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com Fetch your Service Node computer's Public IP address, then copy/paste it to a temporary text file for easy access. Make sure you have easy copy/paste access to your Servicenode Private Key and Servicenode Address , which you got earlier from the Collateral Wallet Setup Procedure . Think of a name for your Service Node. It doesn't have to be the same name you chose to label the address of your Service Node during the Collateral Wallet Setup , but it's often convenient to use the same name. Note, there should be no spaces in the names you choose. Think of a name and a password for the RPC user your Service Node will use when communicating with the services/coins it supports. Change directory to your local exrproxy-env repository ( exrproxy-env is located in ~ by default.): cd ~/exrproxy-env Update your local repository and launch the SNode Builder: Assuming you have previously run the Global Install Script on this server, you can update your local environment repository and launch the SNode builder tool with this command: ./exr_env.sh --update --builder \"\" The --update parameter updates the local repository. The --builder \"\" parameter launches the builder.py tool when the update is complete. If you prefer, you can leave off the --builder \"\" parameter, then call ./builder.py standalone after ./exr_env.sh --update completes, like this: ./exr_env.sh --update ./builder.py IMPORTANT: When passing parameters to ./builder.py through ./exr_env.sh , the parameters of ./builder.py must follow the --builder parameter and they must all be enclosed in double quotes (\"). For example: ./exr_env.sh --builder \"--deploy\" ./exr_env.sh --builder \"--source autobuild/sources.yaml\" ./exr_env.sh --builder \"\" Parameters passed to ./builder.py when it's called as a standalone app do not require double quotes around them. For example: ./builder.py --source autobuild/sources.yaml --deploy First, builder.py will display some information about your system's available hardware resources. This information will be useful in the SNode configuration process. It will look something like this: builder.py will then check to see if the necessary environment, and the necessary versions of docker and docker-compose have been installed on your server. If not, it will instruct you to install them and exit. Next, it will prompt you for your sudo password. Enter your user password, not your root password. Next, it will ask you some questions about how you want to configure your Service Node. If at any time you want to change any of the answers you have given while configuring your SNode, simply issue Control-C to stop the configuration process, then run ./builder.py (or ./exr_env.sh --builder \"\" ) again. The first questions it will ask will be about your Public IP address, Service Node Name, Service Node Private Key, Service Node Address, RPC User and RPC Password. You should have the answers to all these questions already prepared from step 1 above. Next, you'll be presented with a series of queries about which services you want to support on your Service Node. The approximate amount of RAM, # of CPUs, and amount of DISK (SSD) storage space required to support each service will be displayed next to the service name. Note that the cumulative DISK storage space requirements of all the services you select to store data in a particular directory, must be less than the total amount of DISK storage space available in that directory. For example, the sum of the DISK requirements for all the services you select to store data in the /snode directory must be less than the total available space in the /snode directory. (Note, the available space on each of your server's mounted directories is displayed when you first run builder.py , as in step 4 above.) The RAM and CPU requirements for different services are not necessarily cumulative in the same way. For Example, ETH and AVAX both require 16 GB of RAM, but that doesn't necessarily mean you need 32 GB RAM to support both of them on your SNode. However, if you want to have the ability to sync both of them concurrently, or to guarantee optimal performance, then 32+ GB RAM would be recommended. The first services you'll be given the option to support will be the XBridge SPV blockchain services. In the following example, SPV blockchains DASH, LTC, PIVX and SYS have been selected to be supported as XBridge services: Next to each XBridge service in the list, the approximate RAM, # of CPU cores and DISK requirements for the blockchain are displayed. The default data mount directory ( /snode in this example) is also displayed for each blockchain. (In a later step, you'll be given the option to change the data mount directory for specific services.) If you want to change the global default data mount directory for all services you'll deploy, you can change it from /snode to some other directory by following this procedure: Change Global Default Data Mount Directory. Issue Control-C to stop builder.py if it's currently running. Make a copy of autobuild/sources.yaml . For example: cp autobuild/sources.yaml autobuild/my_custom_dir_sources.yaml Use a simple editor like vi or nano , to edit the copy you just made. For Example: vi autobuild/my_custom_dir_sources.yaml In the editor, search for all occurrances of /snode and replace them with whatever new global default you want for your data mount dir . Save the file and exit the editor. Run ./builder.py , passing it a parameter to specify the file you just edited as the source of available coins/services. For example: ./builder.py --source autobuild/my_custom_dir_sources.yaml Next, you'll be given the option to choose which EVM blockchains you want to support. In the following example, both ETH and AVAX EVM blockchains are selected to be supported: The HW requirements and default data mount directory ( /snode in this example) are displayed for each blockchain. Note: The HW requirements listed next to each EVM chain assume the EVM chain will be hosted internally , on the EXR ENV server itself. Supporting an externally hosted EVM does not add any HW requirements to the EXR ENV server. (In a later step, you'll be given the option to specify the Host IPs of the EVM blockchains your SNode will support externally .) If you chose to support EVM blockchains, you'll be given the option to support XQuery and/or Hydra services for each of the EVMs you'll support. If you chose to support XQuery, you'll be given the option to select which indices you want XQuery to support for each EVM you'll support. Supporting all available indices is recommended. For example: Next, if you chose to support XQuery and/or Hydra services, you'll be prompted to enter the US dollar amounts you want to charge for the services you chose to support. If you chose to support XQuery services, you'll be prompted for how many USD you want to charge for access to XQuery. If you chose to support Hydra services, you'll be prompted for how many USD you want to charge for access to Hydra services at tier1 and tier2 levels. (You won't be prompted for tier2 level pricing if you didn't elect to support ETH because tier2 level only applies when ETH is supported.) The USD amounts you enter are what your SNode will charge for 6,000,000 API calls. Pricing in terms of 6,000,000 API calls makes it convenient to compare your pricing with that of other similar services. Default values are recommended. See Hydra/XQuery Projects API for definitions of tier1 and tier2 service levels. Note: Entering 0 for any of the USD amounts you're prompted for will allow clients of your SNode to create projects which have 10,000 free API calls to the service(s) for which you are charging 0 USD. Next, you'll be prompted to enter the discount percentages you want to offer clients for payments in aBLOCK, aaBLOCK or sysBLOCK. These payment discounts are relative to the US dollar amounts entered in the previous step. The idea of giving discounts to clients paying with aBLOCK, aaBLOCK or sysBLOCK comes from the idea that we want to encourage payment in various forms of BLOCK in order to increase demand for BLOCK. Due to high eth gas fees currently associated with paying in aBLOCK, the default discount for aBLOCK is currently set at 20%. Default values are recommended for all discounts. Next, you'll be asked if you want to support UTXO_PLUGIN service. Supporting this service requires about 32 GB RAM, 8 CPU cores and 200 GB of disk space. It doesn't yet offer any financial reward, though a system of rewards for supporting it is planned. Supporting this service does help to make XLite more reliable by increasing the number of data sources from which XLite can achieve an XRouter consensus response when fetching data for the chains it supports. Next, you'll be asked, \" Do you wish to change install locations? \" Type \" y \" here if you want to change the data mount directory of any service from /snode to some other directory. This option can be useful if, for example, you have a separate, very large, fast disk dedicated to supporting ETH, a service which requires large, fast NVMe SSD storage. Selecting \" y \" here will display a selection menu which displays the current data mount directory for each service and allows you to select the services for which you want to change the data mount directory . The selection menu will look something like the following: Next, a storage space calculations table will be displayed which can help you confirm that your server's storage space resources are capable of supporting all the services you've elected to support. The table will look something like this: On analyzing this table, if you determine that your server's storage space resources are not capable of supporting all the services you've elected to support, issue Control-C to stop the configuration process, then run ./builder.py (or ./exr_env.sh --builder \"\" ) again. There are 6 columns in the storage space calculations table: Directory : This column displays the directory in which the data for the service will be stored, called the data mount directory . Available : This column displays the available disk space in the data mount directory of the service. Required : This column displays the approximate space required to host the blockchain of the service. Existing dir : If a previously synced blockchain of the service was found in the data mount directory of the service, this column displays the subdirectory in which the synced blockchain was found (e.g. BTC , LTC ) and size of that synced blockchain (e.g. 456.64 GB , 76.95 GB ). If none was found, it displays no subdirectory and 0 GB for size. Checks : This column displays a green PASS if the data mount directory of the service has enough space to host the service. Otherwise, it displays a red WARNING . Note: A WARNING message in the Checks column should only be ignored if you are certain the value displayed in the Required column is too large/not accurate, and you have carefully calculated that all your selected services will actually fit on the selected data mount directories of your system. Requirement Calculations : This column displays the calculations performed to determine if green PASS or red WARNING should be displayed in the Checks column. If the calculation, \" Available - ( Required - Existing dir )\" yields a positive number, PASS is displayed; Otherwise, WARNING is displayed. At the bottom of the storage space calculations table is a row titled, TOTAL , which gives a cumulative summary of all the rows above. Finally, you'll be given the option to use a unique auto-generated file name, or a user-specified file name for storing the SNode configuration information you've entered. If, for example, you enter the file name latest then a file containing your SNode configuration will be generated in the inputs_yaml directory, and the file will be named, latest.yaml (i.e. your SNode config will be stored as inputs_yaml/latest.yaml ). (Informational) In addition to being stored in the .yaml format mentioned in the previous step, your SNode configuration will also be stored in a processed form in the file, docker-compose.yml . docker-compose.yml will then be used by the ./deploy.sh script when you're ready to deploy your Service Node. Note for advanced users: If you ever want to manually modify the .yaml file mentioned in the previous step, then use your modified .yaml file to generate a new docker-compose.yml file, you can do so using the --yaml parameter like this: ./builder.py --yaml inputs_yaml/latest.yaml Before you deploy your Service Node, you may want to review the SNode config file generated by builder.py (e.g. inputs_yaml/latest.yaml ) to confirm that everything is configured as intended. For example, you may want to review the data mount directory ( data_mount_dir ) for the services which require large amounts of disk space to confirm the specified data_mount_dir has enough disk space available to support the service. If the configuration looks good, you can launch your Service Node by issuing the following command: ./deploy.sh Tip: If you pass the --deploy parameter to ./builder.py , it will automatically call ./deploy.sh after it finishes generating the SNode configuration files. Examples: ./builder.py --deploy ./exr_env.sh --builder \"--deploy\" Most likely you won't need to follow the remaining steps below if you have followed them previously and you're simply reconfiguring your SNode on this run. However, if your SNode has been offline for a while, you may need to reregister it as per steps 26-30 below. You can check if your SNode needs to be reregistered by following steps 29 & 30 below. Didn't see an option to support the service or coin you want to support? Options to support more services/coins are continuously being added. The goal is that Service Nodes will have an option to support every coin supported by BlockDX , which means every coin listed in Blocknet manifest-latest.json . Service Nodes will also soon have the option to support a wide variety of EVM blockchains, like Ethereum/ETH, Avalanche/AVAX, Binance Smart Chain/BSC, Fantom/FTM, Solana/SOL, Polkadot/DOT, Cardano/ADA, etc. Tip: How to Reset Configuration Defaults. builder.py remembers previous SNode configuration choices. Usually this is quite handy and desirable, but sometimes it's useful to make it forget previous configuration choices. There are 5 files builder.py uses to remember previous configuration choices made by the user: .env , .known_hosts , .known_volumes , .cache and .cache_ip . If you want to reset any of the default values builder.py presents to you during the configuration process, deleting (or renaming) one or more of these files before running ./builder.py will likely do the trick. You can also reset all of these files at once like this: ./builder.py --prunecache .env - remembers your Public IP address, Service Node Name, Service Node Private Key, Service Node Address, RPC User and RPC Password. .known_hosts - remembers the IP addresses of any externally hosted EVM chains. .known_volumes - remembers any special data mount directories you chose for specific services. .cache - remembers choices you made about which services to support, and how to set up payments .cache_ip - remembers the IP addresses assigned to docker containers on the last deployment (so it can try to assign the same IP addresses again if they are available).","title":"Run Global Install Script for Enterprise XRouter Environment"},{"location":"service-nodes/setup/#warning-only-expose-hasura-gui-xquery-port-to-restricted-hosts-if-ever","text":"Warning: Only expose Hasura GUI XQuery port to restricted hosts, if ever. It is a security risk to leave Hasura GUI Console port exposed to all hosts. By default, this port is not exposed to outside hosts. However, there may be occassions when an advanced SNode operator wants to expose the Hasura GUI Console port to a select set of outside hosts for a time. For example, it could be useful to allow a client to design an SQL query to the XQuery service on your SNode using the convenient Hasura graphical SQL query interface. See XQuery Hasura GUI Console for instructions on how to view the XQuery Hasura GUI Console in a browser. If you want to expose the Hasura GUI Console port on your SNode, edit the following section in docker-compose.yml just before you run ./deploy.sh : xquery-graphql-engine: image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.0.10 hostname: graphql-engine #ports: # - \"8080:8080\" Uncomment the last two lines of this section, like this xquery-graphql-engine: image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.0.10 hostname: graphql-engine ports: - \"8080:8080\" To restrict access to port 8080 to a limited set of hosts, you can use uncomplicated firewall (ufw) If you are trying to add Service Node support for a new coin which is not yet listed in Blocknet manifest-latest.json configuration file, please refer to the Listing Process for general information on listing a new coin. Then, to add support for the new coin on your Service Node, follow this procedure: Add Support for a New Coin or a New Config of a Coin. Make a copy of autobuild/sources.yaml . For example: cp autobuild/sources.yaml autobuild/custom.yaml Use a simple editor like vi or nano , to edit the copy you just made. For Example: vi autobuild/custom.yaml In the editor, duplicate the entry for some common coin (e.g. LTC), then modify the duplicate entry so that it references the name and docker image of the new coin you want to support. Save the file and exit the editor. Run ./builder.py , passing it two parameters: One to specify the file you just edited as the source of available coins/services, and one to instruct it to reference a configuration repository which contains configuration data for the new coin. For example: ./builder.py --source autobuild/custom.yaml --branchpath https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConanMishler/blockchain-configuration-files/bitcoin--v0.22.0.conf NOTE: The URL passed via the --branchpath parameter must be in raw form, as in the example above. Launch your SNode by issuing the following command: ./deploy.sh Advanced users may want to deploy a Testnet SNode , a Trading Node , or a Testnet Trading Node instead of a regular SNode . These 3 special kinds of nodes are defined here . Deploy a Testnet SNode , a Trading Node , or a Testnet Trading Node . Make a copy of autobuild/sources.yaml . For example: cp autobuild/sources.yaml autobuild/custom.yaml Use a simple editor like vi or nano , to edit the copy you just made. For Example: vi autobuild/custom.yaml In the editor, search for the following text - name: SNODE then change SNODE to one of the following, depending which type of node you want to deploy: testSNODE TNODE testTNODE Save the file and exit the editor. Run ./builder.py , passing it a parameter to specify the file you just edited as the source of available coins/services. For example: ./builder.py --source autobuild/custom.yaml Launch your node by issuing the following command: ./deploy.sh (Recommended for servers with less than 32 GB RAM or less than 10 CPU cores.) If your server HW resources are somewhat limited, it is recommended to deploy certain SNode services in stages. The reason is because some services are known to require large amounts of RAM and/or I/O bandwidth while they are syncing their respective blockchains. ETH, AVAX, LBC and DGB all fall into this category. For this reason, it is recommended not to run more than one of those 4 while any one of them is syncing on a server with limited HW resources. For example, it's best not to run LBC or DGB while AVAX is syncing, or to run AVAX or DGB while LBC is syncing. To deploy SNode services in stages, simply limit which services you select to support the first time you run ./builder.py , then run ./builder.py again after the resource intensive blockchain(s) have synced, this time selecting additional services to support. (Informational) Once your SNode is configured and deployed, you should see the scripts do their magic and launch docker containers for all the services you configured your Service Node to support. You can see all the running docker containers by issuing the command: docker ps This command will display the CONTAINER ID, the IMAGE used to build it, the COMMAND running in the container, when it was CREATED, its current STATUS, which PORTS it uses, and any NAMES assigned to it. To complete the Service Node deployment, we'll need to know either the CONTAINER ID or container NAME of the Service Node container. For that, we can filter the above docker ps output through grep like this: docker ps | grep snode That command should return information about the snode container, something like this: f9b910221ca2 blocknetdx/servicenode:latest \"/opt/blockchain/sta\u2026\" 26 hours ago Up 26 hours 41412/tcp, 41414/tcp, 41419/tcp, 41474/tcp exrproxy-env-snode-1 The first item returned in this example ( f9b910221ca2 ) is the CONTAINER ID, and the last item returned ( exrproxy-env-snode-1 ) is the NAME of the container. Either of these two values can be used to access the snode container. It will take 3.5+ hours for the Blocknet blockchain to sync in your snode container. Periodically monitor the current block height of the Blocknet wallet running in the snode container by issuing the following command: docker exec exrproxy-env-snode-1 blocknet-cli getblockcount Note, here we are executing the command, blocknet-cli within the exrproxy-env-snode-1 container, which is the name we found for the snode container in the previous step. Also note, initial calls to getblockcount may return errors until headers finish syncing. This is normal and nothing to be concerned about. Tips for monitoring block height during syncing, and generally accessing blocknet-cli more easily. To make access to the blocknet-cli program more convenient, you may want to create an alias something like the following: alias snode-cli='docker exec exrproxy-env-snode-1 blocknet-cli' If you add that alias to ~/.bash_aliases (or any file sourced on login), it will be defined automatically every time you login to your Linux system. Another idea is to create a small Bash Shell script something like this: #!/bin/bash docker exec exrproxy-env-snode-1 blocknet-cli $* If you create such a shell script, give it a name like snode-cli , give it executable permissions ( chmod +x snode-cli ), then move it to some directory in your $PATH , then you can use the Linux watch utility like this: watch snode-cli getblockcount (Enter echo $PATH to see which directories are in your $PATH . Enter man watch to learn about the watch utility and its options.) When the block height in the snode container matches that of the Blocknet blockchain explorer , your Service Node wallet is fully synced and you can now activate your Service Node as follows: On your Collateral Wallet , issue the command, servicenoderegister . If your Collateral Wallet was set up according to the VPS Staking guide , and the alias for blocknet-cli was also created according to that guide, you can issue the servicenoderegister command as follows: blocknet-cli servicenoderegister Otherwise, if your Collateral Wallet is a GUI/Qt wallet running on a different computer, simply enter servicenoderegister in Tools->Debug Console of your Collateral Wallet . On your Service Node Wallet , issue the servicenodesendping command like this: docker exec exrproxy-env-snode-1 blocknet-cli servicenodesendping (Note, if you created the snode-cli alias or shell script as suggested in the Tip above, you can enter simply, snode-cli servicenodesendping .) On your Service Node Wallet , check to confirm your Service Node is running and supporting all the right coins/services, like this: docker exec exrproxy-env-snode-1 blocknet-cli servicenodestatus This command should return \"status\": \"running\", and also the corrrect/expected list of supported services. You can also verify your Service Node is visible on the network by issuing the following command on your Collateral Wallet : blocknet-cli servicenodestatus (If your Collateral Wallet is a GUI/Qt wallet, simply enter servicenodestatus in Tools->Debug Console of your Collateral Wallet .) (Recommended) Install fail2ban to protect your EXR SNode from malicious http attacks. The following steps are for setting up fail2ban v0.11.1-1 on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS . The steps for setting up other versions of fail2ban should be very similar, but they may not be exactly the same. Install fail2ban Get the xr_proxy-log-path : docker inspect exrproxy-env-xr_proxy-1 | grep '\"LogPath\":' This will return something like the following: \"LogPath\": \"/var/lib/docker/containers/6554ded0f7dd2abc0f415a511ff0099c5233fca6e17f2b409e9f40be4d43d9cf/6554ded0f7dd2abc0f415a511ff0099c5233fca6e17f2b409e9f40be4d43d9cf-json.log\", The /var/lib/docker/containers/<big-hex-number>-json.log part of what's returned is the xr_proxy-log-path we'll need in future steps, so copy it someplace for future use. Find your LAN address range. Your LAN address range can be found by issuing this command: ip addr The ip addr command will return something like this: 1: lo: mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000 link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00 inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 ::1/128 scope host valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever 2: wlp58s0: mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether 9c:b6:d0:d0:fc:b5 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 192.168.1.20/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlp58s0 valid_lft 5962sec preferred_lft 5962sec inet6 fe80::bf14:21e3:4223:e5e4/64 scope link noprefixroute valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever In the above output, you can ignore item 1: called lo (loopback). You can see that the IP address range of the LAN in this example is displayed in item 2: just after the word, inet : 192.168.1.20/24 . The /24 at the end tells us that the first 24 bits of this address define the range of the LAN's subnet mask . 192.168.1.20/24 then represents the full range of addresses used by the LAN in this example system. Copy whatever value represents the full range of the LAN for your system. We'll need it in a future step. Intall fail2ban : sudo apt install fail2ban Initialize setup sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local Edit config file: Use a simple text editor like vi or nano to edit /etc/fail2ban/jail.local . For example: sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local Within /etc/fail2ban/jail.local , search for these 3 commented out lines: #bantime.increment = true #bantime.factor = 1 #bantime.formula = ban.Time * (1<<(ban.Count if ban.Count<20 else 20)) * banFactor Note, these 3 lines will be in different parts of the file, not contiguous as they are displayed above. Uncomment those 3 line by removing the # at the beginning of each line: bantime.increment = true bantime.factor = 1 bantime.formula = ban.Time * (1<<(ban.Count if ban.Count<20 else 20)) * banFactor Search for the following line #ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1 Uncomment this line by removing the # at the begginning of the line so it looks like this: ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1 It will also be good to add the full address range of your LAN, as discovered above in step b , to the end of this line. This will whitelist all the IP addresses of your LAN so they can't get banned. For example, to whitelist all LAN addresses for the example system of step b above, you would simply add a space and then 192.168.1.20/24 to the end of the ipignore line, like this: ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1 192.168.1.20/24 (Be sure to replace 192.168.1.20/24 here with whatever LAN address range you discovered for your system in step b above.) Search for the following line: banaction = iptables-multiport Change it to: banaction = iptables-allports Search for these 3 lines: # # JAILS # Just below those 3 lines, add the following lines, replacing xr_proxy-log-path with the xr_proxy-log-path you found in step a above: [nginx-x00] enabled = true port = http,https filter = nginx-x00 logpath = xr_proxy-log-path maxretry = 1 findtime = 3600 bantime = 24h [nginx-404] enabled = true port = http,https filter = nginx-404 logpath = xr_proxy-log-path maxretry = 1 findtime = 3600 bantime = 1h After replacing xr_proxy-log-path with the value you found in step a above, the logpath = lines will look something like this: logpath = /var/lib/docker/containers/<big-hex-number>-json.log Save your edits to /etc/fail2ban/jail.local and exit the editor. Add Filters: Use a simple text editor like vi or nano to create the file, /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-x00.conf . For example: sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-x00.conf Add the following lines to the file: [Definition] failregex = ^{\"log\":\"<HOST> .* .*\\\\x ignoreregex = Then save the file and exit the editor. Use a simple text editor like vi or nano to create the file, /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-404.conf . For example: sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-404.conf Add the following lines to the file: [Definition] failregex = {\"log\":\"<HOST>.*(GET|POST|HEAD).*( 404 ) ignoreregex = Then save the file and exit the editor. Restart fail2ban service: sudo service fail2ban restart Verify fail2ban is running properly: sudo service fail2ban status Check the logs of fail2ban : sudo tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log (Ctrl-C to exit scrolling logs.) Fix iptables. To complete this last step, you must wait for at least one IP address to get banned in each of the two jails we created above ( nginx-x00 and nginx-404 ). This may take a few hours, so you may want to just let fail2ban run overnight before coming back to this step. Then check the fail2ban logs to confirm there has been at least one IP banned in each of the new jails: sudo less /var/log/fail2ban.log Search with less for nginx-404 and nginx-x00 to confirm at least one IP ban in each jail. Once this has been confirmed, you can fix the system IP tables so the fail2ban logs will no longer print the \"Already Banned\" messages. Fix the IP tables by issuing these two commands: sudo iptables -I FORWARD -j f2b-nginx-x00 sudo iptables -I FORWARD -j f2b-nginx-404 To learn how to add or subtract supported services/coins from your Service Node, and generally navigate and manage the docker containers of your Service Node, continue on to Maintenance of Enterprise XRouter Environment","title":"Warning: Only expose Hasura GUI XQuery port to restricted hosts, if ever."},{"location":"service-nodes/setup/#maintenance-of-enterprise-xrouter-environment","text":"Maintenance of Enterprise XRouter Environment Changing Configuration of an Enterprise XRouter Environment With the advent of the builder.py script, the procedure for changing the configuration of an EXR ENV is basically the same as it is for configuring and deploying an EXR ENV for the first time. That procedure is given in the first 21 steps of the Deploy Enterprise XRouter Environment guide. Note, however, if you've subtracted one or more services/coins from your EXR ENV's supported services because you want to save the disk space occupied by those services/coins, please remember that the blockchain data is not deleted/removed when the docker container of a service is removed by builder.py . The blockchain data of a service/coin persists in the data mount directory you chose for the service when configuring your SNode. If you kept the default data mount directory , which is /snode , then the blockchain data for DGB, for example, will be stored in /snode/DGB , and it can occupy many GB of space. To find out exactly how much space is being used by each service/coin, you can enter: sudo du -d 1 -h /snode which will return something like this: 57G /snode/LTC 3.6G /snode/MONA 222M /snode/testsnode 3.3G /snode/snode 27G /snode/DGB 16K /snode/xr_proxy 11G /snode/RVN 48M /snode/eth_pymt_db Sudo is necessary here because /snode directory is owned by root , not by $USER. So, if you want to stop supporting DGB coin, for example, and you also want to free up the 27GB of space the DGB blockchain is occupying, you'll need to first use ./builder.py to reconfigure and relaunch your SNode without DGB support, then issue the following command to permanently remove DGB blockchain data and free the space it is occupying: sudo rm -rf /snode/DGB Warning: If you've been running a Trading Node on your EXR ENV server, be sure to save any wallet files which may be located in the data mount directory before issuing the the rm -rf command to remove the data mount directory . Warning: Be very careful to enter the rm -rf command very precisely. A typo could be disastrous. Also, be aware that adding support for DGB again after deleting its blockchain data will require the DGB blockchain to sync from scratch. About docker Tip: If the blockchain of one of the services in your EXR ENV gets onto a fork, or gets its database corrupted, often the easiest way to get it back on track is to stop the docker container running the service, then remove data mount directory of the service, then start the service again. You can use ./builder.py to stop the docker container running the service, or you can stop the container manually. For example, to manually stop the DGB container, you would issue this command: docker stop exrproxy-env-DGB-1 Then you could remove the data mount directory like this: sudo rm -rf /snode/DGB Then start the container again like this: docker start exrproxy-env-DGB-1 Warning: If you've been running a Trading Node on your EXR ENV server, be sure to save any wallet files which may be located in the data mount directory before issuing the the rm -rf command to remove the data mount directory . For the most part, the docker commands given thus far in this guide will suffice to manage your EXR ENV . However, if something \"out of the ordinary\" happens, or if you want to do something fancy with your docker objects, there are a few more things it will be good to know about docker: Let's say, for example, you want to interact directly with the DGB daemon, but you aren't sure the name of the DGB CLI executable command. Here's one way to find it: Start an interactive Bash shell in the DGB container: docker exec -it exrproxy-env-DGB-1 /bin/bash You should see a prompt like this: root@f4c21d83d6fe:/opt/blockchain# Find which daemons are running in the DGB container: root@f4c21d83d6fe:/opt/blockchain# ps uax It should show you something like this: USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND root 1 46.4 28.7 8132896 4726660 ? SLsl 11:37 25:38 digibyted -conf=/opt/blockchain/config/digibyte.conf root 29 1.7 0.0 18248 3280 pts/0 Ss 12:33 0:00 /bin/bash root 39 0.0 0.0 34424 2788 pts/0 R+ 12:33 0:00 ps uax Note there is one running process called, digibyted . This is the name of the Digibyte daemon process and it is also a great clue about the name of the CLI command for interacting with the Digibyte daemon. The name of the CLI command can usually be derived from the name of the daemon process by simply replacing the d at the end of the daemon process with -cli , like this: digibyted -> digibyte-cli If you want to verify there is a digibyte-cli command, you can do this: which digibyte-cli which should return this: /usr/bin/digibyte-cli Now you can interact with the Digibyte daemon as follows: root@f4c21d83d6fe:/opt/blockchain# digibyte-cli getblockcount 13535747 Alternatively, we can exit the Bash shell running in the DGB container, then execute the digibyte-cli command from outside the docker container: root@f4c21d83d6fe:/opt/blockchain# exit exit ~$ docker exec exrproxy-env-DGB-1 digibyte-cli getblockcount 13535762 Now let's consider the case where the docker container with which you want to interact does not have Bash shell available. This is [edit: was ] the case for the Syscoin container, for example. Attempting to invoke the Bash shell in the Syscoin container will result in an error: docker exec -it exrproxy-env-SYS-1 /bin/bash OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: exec: \"/bin/bash\": stat /bin/bash: no such file or directory: unknown The solution is to invoke a shell which does exist in the container, like this: docker exec -it exrproxy-env-SYS-1 /bin/sh Another unique feature of [an earlier version of] the Syscoin container is that the syscoin-cli command requires certain parameters to be passed to it in order to work properly. For example: docker exec exrproxy-env-SYS-1 syscoin-cli getblockcount returns error: Could not locate RPC credentials. No authentication cookie could be found, and RPC password is not set. See -rpcpassword and -stdinrpcpass. Configuration file: (/root/.syscoin/syscoin.conf) But invoking syscoin-cli as follows, works properly: docker exec exrproxy-env-SYS-1 syscoin-cli -conf=/opt/blockchain/config/syscoin.conf getblockcount 1218725 Alternatively, this also works: docker exec exrproxy-env-SYS-1 syscoin-cli -datadir=/opt/blockchain/config getblockcount 1218725 Note: The DASH container, and perhaps other containers, will also require these same parameters to be passed to the CLI command. [edit: The latest SYS container does not require the additional parameter] Now let's consider another case where more docker knowledge could be required. Let's consider the case where you try to manually stop and remove all the docker containers of your SNode using docker-compose down in the ~/exrproxy-env directory. Consider the example where docker-compose down fails to complete due to receiving a timeout error something like the following: UnixHTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=None): Read timed out. Some users have actually seen this exact error when trying to run docker-compose down while an I/O intensive process (e.g. lbrycrdd ) is running on the system. Here are some potentially helpful suggestions on how to fix/avoid this timeout error . However, once docker-compose down has failed to complete even once, it can leave your docker environment in a state where some docker containers have been stopped , but have not yet been removed. This state is problematic because your next attempt to bring up your EXR ENV with deploy.sh will give errors saying the container names you're trying to create, already exist. If you suspect such a situation has developed, one thing you can do is to list all docker containers - both running and stopped: docker ps -a If this command shows some containers with a stopped STATUS, then you probably need to remove those stopped containers. Fortunately, docker has a handy prune utility for removing all stopped containers: docker container prune Also, if your docker containers, images, volumes and/or networks get messed up for any reason, or if you end up with docker images on your server which are no longer used and taking up space unnecessarily, docker offers a variety of prune utilities to clean up the current state of your docker environment . Note: In the context of an EXR ENV , executing the following 2 command should be equivalent to docker-compose down : docker stop $(docker ps -q -f name=exrproxy-env_*) docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f name=exrproxy-env_*) This trick can be useful, for example, if docker-compose.yml is accidentally reconfigured before docker-compose down is executed, causing docker-compose down to fail. docker offers a variety of useful utilities for managing and interacting with various docker objects.

If you have not yet setup your Service Node, start with the Service Node Setup Guide . XBridge is a decentralized exchange protocol with the ability to perform non-custodial, trustless, and decentralized exchange between any digital assets that is supported by the Blocknet Protocol. XBridge allows any application to perform decentralized exchange, opening the door to an ecosystem of decentralized trading services (see the list of compatible blockchains ). Service Nodes are used to verify that the UTXOs in the trades are valid and relay the order book. For these services, Service Nodes receive 100% of trade fees . For each market you would like to support and earn fees from, you must host the full nodes of those blockchains. For example, if you are hosting full nodes of Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Blocknet, you would be supporting the following markets: BTC-LTC, BTC-BLOCK, LTC-BTC, LTC-BLOCK, BLOCK-BTC, BLOCK-LTC. Note: Full nodes are required. Lite wallets and Electrum wallets are not supported. You must host full blockchain nodes with txindex=1 . In order to check if you are running a full node, use the getblockchaininfo command. You should see \"pruned\": false, if you are running a full node. If you see \"pruned\": true, then make sure txindex=1 is in that wallet's configureation file and restart the wallet. See the list of compatible blockchains . To setup XBridge, follow these steps: Enable XBridge Configure XBridge Deploy Wallets Enable XBridge \u00b6 XBridge is turned off by default. To turn it on, add enableexchange=1 to blocknet.conf . Changing this to enableexchange=0 will turn off XBridge. Example blocknet.conf : listen=1 server=1 rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 rpcuser=username rpcpassword=password port=41412 rpcport=41414 enableexchange=1 servicenode=1 rpcthreads=8 # equal to number of supported wallets, set to no less than 8 Tip: For best performance... maxconnections= setting should not be specified. rpcthreads= should be set to the number of blockchains you are supporting (if running 24 blockchains, set rpcthreads=24 ). If you are running less than 8 blockchains then it should remain rpcthreads=8 as the minimum. After making these changes you will need to restart your Service Node Blocknet wallet. Configure XBridge \u00b6 To configure XBridge, Blocknet's xbridge.conf file and the wallet configuration files for each supported blockchain must be setup properly. Configuration is specific to the blockchain and wallet version. Here is a list of compatible blockchains and wallet versions . All configuration files can be found in the blockchain-configuration-files Github repo . Blocknet uses a manifest ( view manifest ) to determine which configurations to use based off the blockchain and wallet version. The manifest uses a code-friendly format called JSON. This manifest uses \"version groups\", which is a group of wallet versions for a blockchain that pertain to a specific set of configurations. A blockchain can have multiple version groups, each with different sets of wallet versions. Each version group is separated by {curly brackets} and contains similar sets of information. The information you will need to focus on is the following: Key Example Data (Bitcoin) Description blockchain Bitcoin The name of the blockchain. ticker BTC The blockchain's ticker. ver_name Bitcoin v0.16.x Version group name. versions [\"v0.16.0\",\"v0.16.1\",\"v0.16.2\",\"v0.16.3\"] The wallet versions compatible with this version group. xbridge_conf bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf Filename of XBridge configs for these wallet version. wallet_conf bitcoin--v0.16.0.conf Filename of wallet config for these wallet versions. Wallet Confs \u00b6 In the manifest , find the version group for the blockchain you want to support. For example, if you want to support Bitcoin and have wallet version 0.17.0.1 then find the version group that says \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\" and has \"v0.17.0.1\" listed under \"versions\" . Thre are multiple version groups for Bitcoin, but only 1 version group with v0.17.0.1 listed under it: { \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\", \"ticker\": \"BTC\", \"ver_id\": \"bitcoin--v0.17.0\", \"ver_name\": \"Bitcoin v0.17.x\", \"conf_name\": \"bitcoin.conf\", \"dir_name_linux\": \"bitcoin\", \"dir_name_mac\": \"Bitcoin\", \"dir_name_win\": \"Bitcoin\", \"repo_url\": \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\", \"versions\": [ \"v0.17.0\", \"v0.17.0.1\", \"v0.17.1\" ], \"xbridge_conf\": \"bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf\", \"wallet_conf\": \"bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf\" }, Take a note of the \"wallet_conf\" filename. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1 it is bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf . Navigate to the wallet-confs/ folder of the blockchain configuration files repo: https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/tree/master/wallet-confs Open the file with the filename listed in the version group. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1, filename bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf , that would be this file: https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/wallet-confs/bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf Copy that file's contents. These are the contents of bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf : server=1 listen=1 rpcuser= rpcpassword= rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 port=8333 rpcport=8332 txindex=1 # Legacy addresses must be used (address must begin with \"1\", not \"3\") addresstype=legacy changetype=legacy # Enable deprecated calls deprecatedrpc=signrawtransaction Open the wallet's configuration file. For Bitcoin this is bitcoin.conf . Delete any contents in this file. This is important because and duplicate settings can mess with the configuration. Paste the previously copied file contents into the wallet's configuration file. Enter a username and password for rpcuser= and rpcpassword= . These should be difficult and secure credentials. Enter the IP of your Service Node client for rpcallowip= . If this blockchain will be hosted on the Service Node computer, use rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 (localhost). Save the configuration file. If the blockchain's wallet has been open, you will ned to restart it to load the updated configurations. Repeat this process for each blockchain you want to support. XBridge Conf \u00b6 In the manifest , find the version group for the blockchain you want to support. For example, if you want to support Bitcoin and have wallet version 0.17.0.1 then find the version group that says \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\" and has \"v0.17.0.1\" listed under \"versions\" . Thre are multiple version groups for Bitcoin, but only 1 version group with v0.17.0.1 listed under it: { \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\", \"ticker\": \"BTC\", \"ver_id\": \"bitcoin--v0.17.0\", \"ver_name\": \"Bitcoin v0.17.x\", \"conf_name\": \"bitcoin.conf\", \"dir_name_linux\": \"bitcoin\", \"dir_name_mac\": \"Bitcoin\", \"dir_name_win\": \"Bitcoin\", \"repo_url\": \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\", \"versions\": [ \"v0.17.0\", \"v0.17.0.1\", \"v0.17.1\" ], \"xbridge_conf\": \"bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf\", \"wallet_conf\": \"bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf\" }, Take a note of the \"xbridge_conf\" filename. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1 it is bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf . Navigate to the xbridge-confs/ folder of the blockchain configuration files repo: https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/tree/master/xbridge-confs Open the file with the filename listed in the version group. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1, filename bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf , that would be this file: https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/xbridge-confs/bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf Copy that file's contents. These are the contents of bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf : [BTC] Title=Bitcoin Address= Ip=127.0.0.1 Port=8332 Username= Password= AddressPrefix=0 ScriptPrefix=5 SecretPrefix=128 COIN=100000000 MinimumAmount=0 TxVersion=2 DustAmount=0 CreateTxMethod=BTC MinTxFee=7500 BlockTime=600 GetNewKeySupported=false ImportWithNoScanSupported=false FeePerByte=120 Confirmations=1 Open the xbridge.conf file. This file can be found in the Blocknet wallet data directory. This file is used to tell the Blocknet wallet how to communicate with the other wallets. At the beginning of the file, enter the following main settings: [Main] ExchangeWallets= FullLog=true After the [Main] settings, paste the previously copied file contents. Repeat this process and paste in the XBridge configurations for other blockchains. Update each blockchain's Username= , Password= , and Ip= setting with the rpcuser= , rpcpassword= , and rpcallowip= values from the respective wallet conf file. The Address= setting can be left blank. Add the blockchain's ticker to the ExchangeWallets= setting, separating each one with a comma (no spaces). Save the xbridge.conf file. If the blockchain's wallet has been open, you will need to restart it to load the updated configurations. Alternatively, the dxLoadXBridgeConf command can be used from either the Debug Console or the command line.

If you have not yet setup your Service Node, start with the Service Node Setup Guide . XBridge is a decentralized exchange protocol with the ability to perform non-custodial, trustless, and decentralized exchange between any digital assets that is supported by the Blocknet Protocol. XBridge allows any application to perform decentralized exchange, opening the door to an ecosystem of decentralized trading services (see the list of compatible blockchains ). Service Nodes are used to verify that the UTXOs in the trades are valid and relay the order book. For these services, Service Nodes receive 100% of trade fees . For each market you would like to support and earn fees from, you must host the full nodes of those blockchains. For example, if you are hosting full nodes of Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Blocknet, you would be supporting the following markets: BTC-LTC, BTC-BLOCK, LTC-BTC, LTC-BLOCK, BLOCK-BTC, BLOCK-LTC. Note: Full nodes are required. Lite wallets and Electrum wallets are not supported. You must host full blockchain nodes with txindex=1 . In order to check if you are running a full node, use the getblockchaininfo command. You should see \"pruned\": false, if you are running a full node. If you see \"pruned\": true, then make sure txindex=1 is in that wallet's configureation file and restart the wallet. See the list of compatible blockchains .

If you have not yet setup your Service Node, start with the Service Node Setup Guide . Since XCloud is built on XRouter, you must also complete XRouter configuration . Note: XCloud requires a static IP For XCloud services, your Service Node Computer IP address must remain unchanged (static IP). If using a VPN with an IP that changes, it will impact your ability to provide XCloud services. XCloud makes direct connections and you'll need a WAN IP as your Service Node IP address and if it's behind a router you'll need to port-forward to it. XCloud is a decentralized microservice cloud network that allows you to monetize any microservice, blockchain, API, or cloud tech on your own hardware, in many cases without having to write any code. Some examples of these services are blockchain-based calls such as those provided by Infura, one that returns a list of Syscoin marketplace listings, third party data calls such as one that provides access to CMC's API, or a custom call for a service you create yourself. You have the option to offer these services for free or to charge a fee for each call. Fees can be specified individually for each call. To host a service, follow these steps: Find a service you'd like to provide or create a custom one. Create the configuration file Determine the service type Configure the service Deploy service Additional information For these examples we will use Ethereum's eth_getBalance call. Create Configuration File \u00b6 You will need to create a configuration file (.conf) for the service's settings. Each service requires its own configuration file. These files are kept within the plugins folder in the Blocknet wallet data directory. Create the service's configuration file within the plugins folder. Make sure to follow the naming rules: The service name is also the call that is used when interacting with the service. The service name and service filename must be the same. Service filenames must have the .conf file extention. A service name can only use the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, -, and : If the service is a blockchain call not supported in the default SPV commands, such as eth_getBalance for Ethereum, the recommended convention for the service name is [asset ticker]_[native_command-name] with the ticker lowercase (if the ticker isn't already part of the name). E.g. eth_getBalance (call) and eth_getBalance.conf (config file) Here are examples of service names and filenames: Format Service Name Service Filename Reason Correct eth_getBalance eth_getBalance.conf Follows correct convention and the names are equal. Incorrect eth_getBalance eth_getbalance.conf The service name and service filename do not match. Incorrect eth_getBalance eth-getbalance.conf The service name and service filename do not match. Incorrect eth_getBalance ETH_getbalance.conf The asset ticker should be all lowercase. Incorrect getbalanceETH getbalanceETH.conf The asset ticker should be first followed by and underscore then the command. Correct weatherData weatherData.conf Names match and only uses allowed characters. Incorrect weatherData weather-data.conf The service name and service filename do not match. Incorrect weatherData weatherData.txt The filename extension is .txt instead of .conf. Determine Service Type \u00b6 The type of service is determined by how it's interacted with and will need different configurations. Here are the current supported types with explanations on when to use each: rpc - Use if a service is for a blockchain call on a wallet that's not in a container. See RPC Service Setup . docker - Use if you are running your service within a Docker container, whether it's a wallet or any other type of miscroservice. See Docker Service Setup . shell - Unsupported at this time. Configure Service \u00b6 The configuration file has information required to connect with your service, interact with it, and additional settings like fees and request limits. Follow the guide that pertains to your service type . Note: The configuration file has a 2mb size limit. Note: RPC Services also require xbridge.conf configuration. To support SPV calls, you must also have your xbridge.conf file setup for each of the chains you wish to support and those wallets must remain open and running ( view XBridge setup guide ). If you already have this setup for XRouter SPV calls then you don't need to do anything extra unless you want to support additional chains. For ETH, you will also need JSONVersion=2.0 and ContentType=application/json added to the [ETH] entry in xbridge.conf . This applies to GETH and Parity clients. Here is an example service config file: eth_getBalance.conf parameters=string,string fee=0.01 clientrequestlimit=100 private::type=rpc private::rpcip=127.0.0.1 private::rpcport=8370 private::rpcuser=username private::rpcpassword=password private::rpccommand=eth_getBalance #! Equivalent to: parity-cli eth_getBalance [address] [block_parameter] Settings Description parameters Optional. Use this if the call takes parameters. List the value type of each parameter in the order the parameters are used (e.g. parameters: int,string,string,bool ). Supported types are string , bool , double , and int . fee The fee (in BLOCK) you require for this call. A value of 0 means there is no fee and that the calls are free ( default - see note below). clientrequestlimit The minimum time allowed between calls in milliseconds. A value of -1 means there is no limit ( default - see note below). If client requests exceed this value they will be penalized and eventually banned by your node. fetchlimit The maximum number of blocks processed. The default value is 50 (see note below). A value of -1 means there is no limit. disabled Used to disable a call. A value of 1 means the call is disabled and 0 means the call is enabled ( default - see note below). private::type=rpc** The type of connection. For other connection types, see Service Types . private::rpcip The IP of the Service Node hosting this service. If left blank, localhost is assumed. private::rpcport** The service's RPC port. private::rpcuser** The service's RPC username. private::rpcpassword** The service's RPC password. private::rpccommand** The service's RPC command. private::response Used to hide private responses. For example, if this is a Twilio service and the user sends a text message, the service can send back a \"sent\" response instead of the Twilio response using private::response=sent . private:: Used to keep entries private. These will not be shared with connecting clients. # Used at the beginning of a line for public comments. These will be shared with connecting clients. #! Used at the beginning of a line for private comments. These will NOT be shared with connecting clients. ** Config entries private::type=rpc , private::rpcport , private::rpcuser , private::rpcpassword , and private::rpccommand are mandatory for RPC services. Note: Setting values use hierarchy priority. Values set under [Main] override the default values and become the new default settings for all services that don't have the respective setting specified. Service settings override [Main] and default settings. The setting hierarchy from highiest priority to lowest priority is as follows: Service Settings > [Main] > default . The higher priority settings override the lower priority settings. Tip: Add comments for service description and help messages. Using a public comment, add a description so users know what the service is. Example: #description: Returns the balance for the provided Ethereum address. Using a public comment, add a help message so users know how to use a service. Example: #help: eth_getBalance [address] [block_parameter]; [address] = (string) The address to check for balance; [block_parameter] = (string) Integer block number, or the string 'latest', 'earliest' or 'pending'. There are development plans to add dedicated, officially supported description and help settings. Docker \u00b6 Here is an example service config file: eth_getBalance.conf parameters=string fee=0.01 clientrequestlimit=100 private::type=docker private::containername=eth private::command=parity-cli eth_getBalance private::args=$1 private::quoteargs=1 !# Equivalent to: docker exec eth parity-cli eth_getBalance [address] [block_parameter] Settings Description parameters Optional. Use this if the call takes parameters. List the value type of each parameter in the order the parameters are used (e.g. parameters: int,string,string,bool ). Supported types are string , bool , double , and int . fee The fee (in BLOCK) you require for this call. A value of 0 means there is no fee and that the calls are free ( default - see note below). clientrequestlimit The minimum time allowed between calls in milliseconds. A value of -1 means there is no limit ( default - see note below). If client requests exceed this value they will be penalized and eventually banned by your node. fetchlimit The maximum number of blocks processed. The default value is 50 (see note below). A value of -1 means there is no limit. disabled Used to disable a call. A value of 1 means the call is disabled and 0 means the call is enabled ( default - see note below). private::type=docker* The type of connection. For other connection types, see Service Types . private::containername* The name of the service's Docker container. private::command* The service's Docker command. private::args The arguments from parameters to pass to the command, denoted with a $ and the number of the argument passed as a parameter. The order the arguments are specified is the order they will be passed to the command. This order does not have to be the same order as used in parameters, although the numbers correlate with that order placement. You can pass additional values that haven't been passed as parameters (see example below). private::quoteargs Use this to quote the arguments in args . A value of 1 will quote each argument and 0 will not ( default - see note below). private::response Used to hide private responses. For example, if this is a Twilio service and the user sends a text message, the service can send back a \"sent\" response instead of the Twilio response using private::response=sent . private:: Used to keep entries private. These will not be shared with connecting clients. # Used at the beginning of a line for public comments. These will be shared with connecting clients. #! Used at the beginning of a line for private comments. These will not be shared with connecting clients. * Config entries private::type=docker , private::containername , and private::command are mandatory for Docker services. Note: Setting values use hierarchy priority. Values set under [Main] override the default values and become the new default settings for all services that don't have the respective setting specified. Service settings override [Main] and default settings. The setting hierarchy from highiest priority to lowest priority is as follows: Service Settings > [Main] > default . The higher priority settings override the lower priority settings. Tip: Add comments for service description and help messages. Using a public comment, add a description so users know what the service is. Example: #description: Returns the balance for the provided Ethereum address. Using a public comment, add a help message so users know how to use a service. Example: #help: eth_getBalance [address] [block_parameter]; [address] = (string) The address to check for balance; [block_parameter] = (string) Integer block number, or the string 'latest', 'earliest' or 'pending'. There are development plans to add dedicated, officially supported description and help settings. Deploy Service \u00b6 Add the service name to the plugins= entry in xrouter.conf . The service name listed must be the exact name of your config file without the file extension. Separate each service name with a comma. Example: If you had 3 services that you wanted to deply with config names eth_getBalance.conf , eth_blockNumber.conf , and weatherData.conf , the plugins= setting would read as follows: plugins=eth_getBalance,eth_blockNumber,weatherData Use xrReloadConfigs to load your newly configured settings to xrouter.conf without needing to restart your Service Node. Use servicenodesendping to propogate these new settings to the network immediately or wait up to 3 minutes for this to happen automatically. You can view your configs using xrStatus ( See example output ). Post your services to the forum so others can discover, learn more, and find instructions on how to interact with your service. Additional Information \u00b6 Fees \u00b6 While Service Nodes can set their own fees, users can also set the max fee they will pay. Any Service Node's with a fee that is higher than a user's max fee will not be used. It is recommended to offer free calls for any call that are not computationally intesive. Lower fees will help encourage an ecosystem to build around the network. A healthy ecosystem will lead to much more usage of the network and receiving a lot of small fees will be more beneficial than receiving a few high fees. Granted, some calls may actually take computational time and will therefore require a higher fee. Snode Scoring \u00b6 Clients keep a score of each Service Node. When a Service Node reaches a score of -200 , the Service Node will be banned by the client for a 24hr period. After this 24hr period, the Service Node will start with a score of -25 .

Note: XCloud requires a static IP For XCloud services, your Service Node Computer IP address must remain unchanged (static IP). If using a VPN with an IP that changes, it will impact your ability to provide XCloud services. XCloud makes direct connections and you'll need a WAN IP as your Service Node IP address and if it's behind a router you'll need to port-forward to it. XCloud is a decentralized microservice cloud network that allows you to monetize any microservice, blockchain, API, or cloud tech on your own hardware, in many cases without having to write any code. Some examples of these services are blockchain-based calls such as those provided by Infura, one that returns a list of Syscoin marketplace listings, third party data calls such as one that provides access to CMC's API, or a custom call for a service you create yourself. You have the option to offer these services for free or to charge a fee for each call. Fees can be specified individually for each call.

If you have not yet setup your Service Node, start with the Service Node Setup Guide . Note: XRouter requires a static IP For XRouter services, your Service Node Computer IP address must remain unchanged (static IP) and use port 41412 . If using a VPN with an IP that changes, it will impact your ability to provide XRouter services. XRouter makes direct connections and you'll need a WAN IP as your Service Node IP address and if it's behind a router you'll need to port-forward to it. XRouter is a decentralized interoperability protocol with an SPV client backend supported by Service Nodes that allows users to validate transactions and ensure transactions are in a block. These calls are supported by default if XRouter is enabled with no additional settings. For example, if you have a fully synced Bitcoin node with txindex on, you can use XRouter to sell transaction information on Bitcoin's blockchain. So if a user doesn't want to download the full chain, but needs to know information about a transaction, they could query your XRouter node and you can charge them a fee to do so. You have the option to offer these services for free or to charge a fee for each call. Fees can be set to be specific for each individual call. To setup XRouter, follow these steps: Configure XRouter Optimize Setup Deploy SPV Wallets Additional Information Setup XCloud (option): XCloud is a decentralized microservice cloud network that allows you to monetize any microservice, blockchain, API, or cloud tech on your own hardware, many cases without having to write any code. Configure XRouter \u00b6 When starting the wallet, an xrouter.conf file is automatically created in the Blocknet wallet data directory if not already present. The xrouter.conf file is used to specify all your general XRouter settings and SPV call settings. Note: SPV support also requires xbridge.conf configuration. To support SPV calls, you must also have your xbridge.conf file setup for each of the chains you wish to support and those wallets must remain open and running ( view XBridge setup guide ). For ETH, you will also need JSONVersion=2.0 and ContentType=application/json added to the [ETH] entry in xbridge.conf . This applies to GETH and Parity clients. Similar to xbridge.conf , the general XRouter settings are specified under a [Main] heading. Settings Description host The static public IP address of your SNode Computer. wallets The wallets you'd like to support XRouter calls on. All commands are on by default for all supported wallets listed in wallets= . If you want to turn one of them off, set disabled=1 in the call's subsection. plugins The XCloud services you are supporting, see XCloud Configuration . fee The fee (in BLOCK) you require for calls. A value of 0 means there is no fee and that the calls are free ( default ). Fees can be specified for individual calls in each subsection. clientrequestlimit The minimum time allowed between calls in milliseconds. A value of -1 means there is no limit ( default ). If client requests exceed this value they will be penalized and eventually banned by your node. disabled** Used to disable a call. A value of 1 means the call is disabled and 0 means the call is enabled ( default ). This setting is only for subsections and not supported under [Main] . fetchlimit The maximum number of records returned. This pertains to calls such as xrGetBlocks and xrGetTransactions where multiple records are returned. The default value is 50 . A value of -1 means there is no limit. ** Only for subsection settings, not supported under [Main] . Note: Setting values use hierarchy priority. Values set under [Main] override the default values and become the new default settings for all subsections that don't have the respective setting specified. Subsection settings override [Main] and default settings. Wallet-specific subsections have the highest priority and override all other settings. The setting hierarchy from highiest priority to lowest priority is as follows: [BTC::xrGetBlockCount] > [BTC] > [xrGetBlockCount] > [Main] > default . The higher priority settings override the lower priority settings. Note: The host and wallets settings are required. In your xrouter.conf you must have host= and wallets= included and specified or it will be invalid. Example xrouter.conf : [Main] host=208.67.222.222 wallets=BLOCK,SYS,BTC plugins= fee=0 paymentaddress= clientrequestlimit=50 [xrGetBlockCount] fee=0.01 [xrGetBlockHash] fee=0.01 [xrGetTransaction] fee=0.1 clientrequestlimit=20 [BTC::xrGetTransactions] fee=0.5 timeout=50 fetchlimit=20 [BTC::xrGetBlocks] fee=0.3 timeout=30 fetchlimit=20 [xrGetBlocks] disabled=1 fetchlimit=50 Here is a list of current SPV calls: Call Description xrGetBlockCount Returns a blockchain's block height xrGetBlockHash Returns a block number's hash xrGetBlock Returns a block hash's block number xrGetBlocks Returns block hashes for multiple block numbers xrDecodeRawTransaction Returns decoded transaction HEX xrGetTransaction Returns transaction data for transaction ID xrGetTransactions Returns transaction data for multiple transaction IDs xrSendTransaction Submit a signed transaction to the network Optimize Setup \u00b6 Note: XRouter requires a static IP For XRouter services, your Service Node Computer IP address must remain unchanged (static IP) and use port 41412 . If using a VPN with an IP that changes, it will impact your ability to provide XRouter services. XRouter makes direct connections and you'll need a WAN IP as your Service Node IP address and if it's behind a router you'll need to port-forward to it. SNode Computer blocknet.conf Optimizations For the blocknet.conf on the SNode Computer wallet: maxconnections= should NOT be specified. rpcthreads= should be set to the number of blockchains you are supporting (if running 24 blockchains, set rpcthreads=24 ). If you are running less than 8 blockchains then it should remain at rpcthreads=8 as the minimum. After making these changes you will need to restart your Service Node Blocknet wallet. Deploy SPV Wallets \u00b6 Add the chains you want to support SPV calls for in the wallets= entry in xrouter.conf , denoted by the chain's asset's ticker. Separate each wallet name with a comma. Example: wallets=SYS,BLOCK,BTC,ETH,MNP If you added or removed blockchain support, make sure to also update the rpcthreads= value in the blocknet.conf file. Use xrReloadConfigs to load your newly configured settings to xrouter.conf without needing to restart your Service Node. Use servicenodesendping to propogate these new settings to the network immediately or wait up to 3 minutes for this to happen automatically. You can view your configs using xrStatus . Additional Information \u00b6 Fees \u00b6 While Service Nodes can set their own fees, users can also set the max fee they will pay. Any Service Node's with a fee that is higher than a user's max fee will not be used. It is recommended to offer free calls for any call that are not computationally intesive. Lower fees will help encourage an ecosystem to build around the network. A healthy ecosystem will lead to much more usage of the network and receiving a lot of small fees will be more beneficial than receiving a few high fees. Granted, some calls may actually take computational time and will therefore require a higher fee. SNode Scoring \u00b6 Clients keep a score of each Service Node.

If you have not yet setup your Service Node, start with the Service Node Setup Guide . Note: XRouter requires a static IP For XRouter services, your Service Node Computer IP address must remain unchanged (static IP) and use port 41412 . If using a VPN with an IP that changes, it will impact your ability to provide XRouter services. XRouter makes direct connections and you'll need a WAN IP as your Service Node IP address and if it's behind a router you'll need to port-forward to it. XRouter is a decentralized interoperability protocol with an SPV client backend supported by Service Nodes that allows users to validate transactions and ensure transactions are in a block. These calls are supported by default if XRouter is enabled with no additional settings. For example, if you have a fully synced Bitcoin node with txindex on, you can use XRouter to sell transaction information on Bitcoin's blockchain. So if a user doesn't want to download the full chain, but needs to know information about a transaction, they could query your XRouter node and you can charge them a fee to do so. You have the option to offer these services for free or to charge a fee for each call. Fees can be set to be specific for each individual call. To setup XRouter, follow these steps: Configure XRouter Optimize Setup Deploy SPV Wallets Additional Information Setup XCloud (option): XCloud is a decentralized microservice cloud network that allows you to monetize any microservice, blockchain, API, or cloud tech on your own hardware, many cases without having to write any code.","title":"XRouter Configuration Guide"},{"location":"service-nodes/xrouter-configuration/#configure-xrouter","text":"When starting the wallet, an xrouter.conf file is automatically created in the Blocknet wallet data directory if not already present. The xrouter.conf file is used to specify all your general XRouter settings and SPV call settings. Note: SPV support also requires xbridge.conf configuration. To support SPV calls, you must also have your xbridge.conf file setup for each of the chains you wish to support and those wallets must remain open and running ( view XBridge setup guide ). For ETH, you will also need JSONVersion=2.0 and ContentType=application/json added to the [ETH] entry in xbridge.conf . This applies to GETH and Parity clients. Similar to xbridge.conf , the general XRouter settings are specified under a [Main] heading. Settings Description host The static public IP address of your SNode Computer. wallets The wallets you'd like to support XRouter calls on. All commands are on by default for all supported wallets listed in wallets= . If you want to turn one of them off, set disabled=1 in the call's subsection. plugins The XCloud services you are supporting, see XCloud Configuration . fee The fee (in BLOCK) you require for calls. A value of 0 means there is no fee and that the calls are free ( default ). Fees can be specified for individual calls in each subsection. clientrequestlimit The minimum time allowed between calls in milliseconds. A value of -1 means there is no limit ( default ). If client requests exceed this value they will be penalized and eventually banned by your node. disabled** Used to disable a call. A value of 1 means the call is disabled and 0 means the call is enabled ( default ). This setting is only for subsections and not supported under [Main] . fetchlimit The maximum number of records returned. This pertains to calls such as xrGetBlocks and xrGetTransactions where multiple records are returned. The default value is 50 . A value of -1 means there is no limit. ** Only for subsection settings, not supported under [Main] . Note: Setting values use hierarchy priority. Values set under [Main] override the default values and become the new default settings for all subsections that don't have the respective setting specified. Subsection settings override [Main] and default settings. Wallet-specific subsections have the highest priority and override all other settings. The setting hierarchy from highiest priority to lowest priority is as follows: [BTC::xrGetBlockCount] > [BTC] > [xrGetBlockCount] > [Main] > default . The higher priority settings override the lower priority settings. Note: The host and wallets settings are required. In your xrouter.conf you must have host= and wallets= included and specified or it will be invalid.

The file called wallet.dat contains all the critical information for accessing your wallet, and that is the file which should be backed up (copied) to multiple physically different locations. For example, it is recommended to keep copies of this file on multiple USB drives and store them in different locations. Also, unless your wallet is an HD Wallet and you are certain no non-HD PrivateKey/Address pairs have been imported into your wallet, the latest version of wallet.dat should be backed up whenever funds are added to a new address in your wallet. Your wallet.dat file is typically stored in the wallets subdirectory of your data directory: Data Directory \u00b6 Windows C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Blocknet\\ Or paste %appdata%\\Blocknet\\ into the File Explorer path field. MacOS ~/Library/Application Support/Blocknet/ Open Finder and in the Go menu select Go to Folder... and enter the above path. Linux ~/.blocknet/ CLI Wallet Backup Options (also works for GUI/Qt wallet) \u00b6 Option 1 - Close/Quit Blocknet wallet, then backup wallet.dat To ensure wallet.dat is not being modified as you are copying it, Close/Quit Blocknet wallet. If you are running a CLI wallet on a Linux OS, quit your wallet by issuing the CLI command, ./blocknet-cli stop in the directory where blocknet-cli is located. Note, if your CLI wallet was set up on a Linux system according to the VPS Staking guide , you can stop your CLI wallet from any directory with: blocknet-cli stop Wait till your Wallet stops completely. If running the GUI/Qt wallet, this means waiting till the \" Blocknet is shutting down... \" message disappears. If running a CLI wallet on Linux, you can monitor the Linux process called blocknetd by repeatedly pasting/issuing the following command: ps x -o args | grep -v \"grep\" | grep \"blocknetd\" Before the blocknetd Linux process has stopped completely, that command will return something like this: /home/[user]/blocknet-4.3.3/bin/blocknetd -daemon Continue issuing that ps x -o args command until it returns nothing. Then you know the blocknetd process has stopped completely and it's safe to backup/copy your wallet.dat file. Within the data directory there is usually a subdirectory called wallets which is the default place for wallet.dat . If you find a wallet.dat file in the wallets subdirectory, that is the file which should be backed up. If the wallets subdirectory does not exist, then the wallet.dat in the data directory itself is the file which should be backed up. Back up your wallet.dat simply by copying it to different computer(s) and/or USB drives. Restart your Blocknet wallet. If you are running a CLI wallet on a Linux OS, restart your wallet by issuing the CLI command, ./blocknetd -daemon in the directory where blocknetd is located. Note, if your CLI wallet was set up on a Linux system according to the VPS Staking guide , you can restart your CLI wallet from any directory with: blocknet-daemon Option 2 - Issue backupwallet <backupfile.dat> command from Debug Console or Command Line Interface This option does not require that you Close/Quit the Blocknet wallet. Be sure to specify the full path of your backupfile.dat and make sure it's in a directory where you have write permission. Example: (Mac): backupwallet /Users/(username)/Desktop/mywallet.dat Example (Windows): backupwallet c:\\Users\\(username)\\Desktop\\mywallet.dat GUI/Qt Backup Option \u00b6 If you are using the GUI/Qt wallet, one way to be certain to back up the correct wallet.dat file is to select the File->Backup Wallet... option in the GUI interface: This gives you the option to write a backup of your current wallet.dat to any location and give it any name. Dumpfile Backup Option \u00b6 If you want to be extra sure you'll be able to restore your wallet, in addition to backing up your wallet.dat , you can also back up your wallet in a dumpfile format. This format can be especially useful for those who are using an HD Wallet because it backs up the wallet's HD seed(s) in a human-readable format. Tip: Is my wallet an HD Wallet ? How do I find HD seed(s) in the dumpfile ? How do I migrate to HD? In the lower right corner of the Qt/GUI wallet are some symbols that look something like this: If you see HD there (not crossed out or greyed out), then your wallet is an HD Wallet . Note: All wallets created with Blocknet v4.0 or greater are HD wallets. To find your wallet's HD seed(s), search the dumpfile for hdseed=1 . See the answer posted here for full details on the format of dumpfile . If your wallet is not an HD wallet and you want to be using a new HD wallet, the way to acheive that is to create an HD wallet (by creating a new wallet with the latest version of the Blocknet wallet ), then transfer all your BLOCK to your new HD wallet. Note: You can, for example, create your new HD wallet on a different computer or in a different data directory on your existing computer. That way you can continue to have access to your old non-HD wallet until funds have been transferred to the new HD wallet. Another option is to create a new HD wallet simply by renaming the non-HD wallet.dat to something else, then restarting Blocknet wallet (v4.0+). The full instructions for doing it this way are as follows: Locate your current, non-HD wallet.dat . Rename that wallet.dat to wallet.dat.non-hd . Restart Blocknet wallet (must be Blocknet wallet v4.0+). Back up the new HD wallet.dat which was created by restarting your wallet. Created a receive address within your new HD wallet ( Address Book->Create New Address->My Address ) and copy it into a temporary file. Close Blocknet wallet Rename the new HD wallet.dat to wallet.dat.hd . Rename wallet.dat.non-hd back to wallet.dat . Restart Blocknet wallet. Send all your BLOCK from your old non-HD wallet to the newly created receive address in your new HD wallet. Note, if you want to start out by sending a small test amount from your old non-HD wallet to your new HD wallet, you can certainly do so. It just means you'll have to repeat the procedures for switching back and forth between your old non-HD wallet and your new HD wallet. Close Blocknet wallet. Rename the wallet.dat to wallet.dat.non-hd . Rename wallet.dat.hd back to wallet.dat . Restart Blocknet. To back up your wallet in a dumpfile format, issue the following command: dumpwallet <dumpfile> This command can be issued from Tools->Debug Console , or from the CLI if using a Command Line Interface to the wallet. The dumpwallet <dumpfile> command will dump all your wallet's Private Key/Address pairs in a human-readable format to the file you specify as your dumpfile . Note: Be sure to specify the full path of dumpfile and make sure it's in a directory where you have write permission. Example: (Mac): dumpwallet /Users/(username)/Desktop/dumpfile.txt Example (Windows): dumpwallet c:\\Users\\(username)\\Desktop\\dumpfile.txt Caution: It is strongly recommended NOT to keep this dumpfile stored on a computer while the computer is connected to the Internet. You can print the dumpfile , then delete it, then empty your Trash. You can also store it within a 256-bit encrypted folder on your computer and/or on USB drives. (Google for how to encrypt a folder on Windows/Mac.) However, due to the extremely sensitive information in this file, it should NOT be kept stored on a computer that can be connected to the Internet (unless it is within a 256-bit encrypted folder). Restore \u00b6 Restore from wallet.dat \u00b6 To restore a previously backed up wallet.dat file, follow these steps: If you haven't already done so, Install Blocknet Wallet and sync it Close your Blocknet wallet application. Rename or move the wallet.dat file in your data directory , if there is one. If there is a wallets subdirectory/folder in the data directory and it contains a file called wallet.dat , rename that wallet.dat file to something like wallet.dat.empty . If a wallets subdirectory/folder doesn't already exist in the data directory, make a new wallets subdirectory/folder in the data directory. Copy your backup copy of wallet.dat into the wallets subdirectory of your data directory . Note, it's fine to name your wallet.dat to something else while it's being stored safely in other locations. However, it must be named, wallet.dat when placed in the wallets subdirectory if the Blocknet wallet app is going to find it. Note, instead of copying your backup wallet.dat into the wallets subdirectory, you could optionally copy it into the data directory itself. However, if you choose this option, be sure to remove the wallets subdirectory because the Blocknet application will not use a wallet.dat file in the data directory itself if a wallets subdirectory exists. Restart Blocknet wallet. Restore from dumpfile \u00b6 Firstly, if you haven't already done so, Install Blocknet Wallet and sync it Next, there are three options: If you backed up your wallet using the dumpwallet <dumpfile> command, you can restore it simply by issuing the importwallet <dumpfile> command from either Tools->Debug Console or from the CLI if using the Command Line Interface. This is the recommended method of restoring from a dumpfile . Another option you have if you are restoring an HD Wallet and you are certain no non-HD PrivateKey/Address pairs were imported into the wallet you want to restore, is to extract the HD seed from the dumpfile , then use the sethdseed ( newkeypool \"seed\" ) command to effectively import all the PrivateKey/Address pairs of the HD wallet. Type, help sethdseed in the Debug Console or CLI for more details on the sethdseed command. It's also possible to use the importprivkey command to import individual PrivateKey/Address pairs, where the Private Key could come from the dumpfile , or from the output of a dumpprivkey command issued in some wallet. The use of these commands is not generally recommended, especially if you are using an HD wallet.

If you are running a CLI wallet on a Linux OS, quit your wallet by issuing the CLI command, ./blocknet-cli stop in the directory where blocknet-cli is located. Note, if your CLI wallet was set up on a Linux system according to the VPS Staking guide , you can stop your CLI wallet from any directory with: blocknet-cli stop Wait till your Wallet stops completely. If running the GUI/Qt wallet, this means waiting till the \" Blocknet is shutting down... \" message disappears. If running a CLI wallet on Linux, you can monitor the Linux process called blocknetd by repeatedly pasting/issuing the following command: ps x -o args | grep -v \"grep\" | grep \"blocknetd\" Before the blocknetd Linux process has stopped completely, that command will return something like this: /home/[user]/blocknet-4.3.3/bin/blocknetd -daemon Continue issuing that ps x -o args command until it returns nothing. Then you know the blocknetd process has stopped completely and it's safe to backup/copy your wallet.dat file. Within the data directory there is usually a subdirectory called wallets which is the default place for wallet.dat . If you find a wallet.dat file in the wallets subdirectory, that is the file which should be backed up. If the wallets subdirectory does not exist, then the wallet.dat in the data directory itself is the file which should be backed up. Back up your wallet.dat simply by copying it to different computer(s) and/or USB drives. Restart your Blocknet wallet. If you are running a CLI wallet on a Linux OS, restart your wallet by issuing the CLI command, ./blocknetd -daemon in the directory where blocknetd is located. Note, if your CLI wallet was set up on a Linux system according to the VPS Staking guide , you can restart your CLI wallet from any directory with: blocknet-daemon Option 2 - Issue backupwallet <backupfile.dat> command from Debug Console or Command Line Interface This option does not require that you Close/Quit the Blocknet wallet. Be sure to specify the full path of your backupfile.dat and make sure it's in a directory where you have write permission.

This format can be especially useful for those who are using an HD Wallet because it backs up the wallet's HD seed(s) in a human-readable format. Tip: Is my wallet an HD Wallet ? How do I find HD seed(s) in the dumpfile ? How do I migrate to HD? In the lower right corner of the Qt/GUI wallet are some symbols that look something like this: If you see HD there (not crossed out or greyed out), then your wallet is an HD Wallet . Note: All wallets created with Blocknet v4.0 or greater are HD wallets. To find your wallet's HD seed(s), search the dumpfile for hdseed=1 . See the answer posted here for full details on the format of dumpfile . If your wallet is not an HD wallet and you want to be using a new HD wallet, the way to acheive that is to create an HD wallet (by creating a new wallet with the latest version of the Blocknet wallet ), then transfer all your BLOCK to your new HD wallet. Note: You can, for example, create your new HD wallet on a different computer or in a different data directory on your existing computer. That way you can continue to have access to your old non-HD wallet until funds have been transferred to the new HD wallet. Another option is to create a new HD wallet simply by renaming the non-HD wallet.dat to something else, then restarting Blocknet wallet (v4.0+). The full instructions for doing it this way are as follows: Locate your current, non-HD wallet.dat . Rename that wallet.dat to wallet.dat.non-hd . Restart Blocknet wallet (must be Blocknet wallet v4.0+). Back up the new HD wallet.dat which was created by restarting your wallet. Created a receive address within your new HD wallet ( Address Book->Create New Address->My Address ) and copy it into a temporary file. Close Blocknet wallet Rename the new HD wallet.dat to wallet.dat.hd . Rename wallet.dat.non-hd back to wallet.dat . Restart Blocknet wallet. Send all your BLOCK from your old non-HD wallet to the newly created receive address in your new HD wallet. Note, if you want to start out by sending a small test amount from your old non-HD wallet to your new HD wallet, you can certainly do so. It just means you'll have to repeat the procedures for switching back and forth between your old non-HD wallet and your new HD wallet. Close Blocknet wallet. Rename the wallet.dat to wallet.dat.non-hd . Rename wallet.dat.hd back to wallet.dat . Restart Blocknet. To back up your wallet in a dumpfile format, issue the following command: dumpwallet <dumpfile> This command can be issued from Tools->Debug Console , or from the CLI if using a Command Line Interface to the wallet. The dumpwallet <dumpfile> command will dump all your wallet's Private Key/Address pairs in a human-readable format to the file you specify as your dumpfile . Note: Be sure to specify the full path of dumpfile and make sure it's in a directory where you have write permission. Example: (Mac): dumpwallet /Users/(username)/Desktop/dumpfile.txt Example (Windows): dumpwallet c:\\Users\\(username)\\Desktop\\dumpfile.txt Caution: It is strongly recommended NOT to keep this dumpfile stored on a computer while the computer is connected to the Internet. You can print the dumpfile , then delete it, then empty your Trash. You can also store it within a 256-bit encrypted folder on your computer and/or on USB drives. (Google for how to encrypt a folder on Windows/Mac.) However, due to the extremely sensitive information in this file, it should NOT be kept stored on a computer that can be connected to the Internet (unless it is within a 256-bit encrypted folder).","title":"Dumpfile Backup Option"},{"location":"wallet/backup-restore/#restore","text":"","title":"Restore"},{"location":"wallet/backup-restore/#restore-from-walletdat","text":"To restore a previously backed up wallet.dat file, follow these steps: If you haven't already done so, Install Blocknet Wallet and sync it Close your Blocknet wallet application. Rename or move the wallet.dat file in your data directory , if there is one. If there is a wallets subdirectory/folder in the data directory and it contains a file called wallet.dat , rename that wallet.dat file to something like wallet.dat.empty . If a wallets subdirectory/folder doesn't already exist in the data directory, make a new wallets subdirectory/folder in the data directory. Copy your backup copy of wallet.dat into the wallets subdirectory of your data directory . Note, it's fine to name your wallet.dat to something else while it's being stored safely in other locations. However, it must be named, wallet.dat when placed in the wallets subdirectory if the Blocknet wallet app is going to find it. Note, instead of copying your backup wallet.dat into the wallets subdirectory, you could optionally copy it into the data directory itself. However, if you choose this option, be sure to remove the wallets subdirectory because the Blocknet application will not use a wallet.dat file in the data directory itself if a wallets subdirectory exists.

This is the recommended method of restoring from a dumpfile . Another option you have if you are restoring an HD Wallet and you are certain no non-HD PrivateKey/Address pairs were imported into the wallet you want to restore, is to extract the HD seed from the dumpfile , then use the sethdseed ( newkeypool \"seed\" ) command to effectively import all the PrivateKey/Address pairs of the HD wallet. Type, help sethdseed in the Debug Console or CLI for more details on the sethdseed command. It's also possible to use the importprivkey command to import individual PrivateKey/Address pairs, where the Private Key could come from the dumpfile , or from the output of a dumpprivkey command issued in some wallet. The use of these commands is not generally recommended, especially if you are using an HD wallet.

However, for various reasons, the Blocknet Wallet can occasionally display the wrong balance for an extended time, in which case you'll need to Recover Transactions from the blockchain before it will display the correct balance. You can confirm if your wallet needs a Recover Transactions operation as follows: Select Window->Coin Control to display the addresses (and UTXOs ) where funds are stored in your wallet: This will display a screen like this ( in Tree mode ): Note: If using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to the wallet, you can get the same information as above by issuing the listunspent command from the directory where your blocknet-cli program is stored, like this: ./blocknet-cli listunspent You can also issue listunspent from Tools->Debug Console in the GUI/Qt wallet.

The start of a fork is the point at which the blockchain data starts to differ. If you are the user with the different data from everyone else, then you are on a fork (forked chain). Note: BLOCK staked on a fork are not valid on the main chain. If you are on a fork you will likely earn many more staking rewards than usual.

Next, if desired, enter a custom change address . Next, in the Coin Control section of this screen you have the option to either let the Blocknet wallet automatically select the inputs from which it will send BLOCK, or choose the inputs manually.

If you don't see the Coin Control features as shown in the screen above, use your mouse wheel or trackpad to scroll the window until they appear. Alternatively, expand the size of the window until the Coin Control features appear. Coin Control \u00b6 Funds in your wallet are organized in terms of addresses and inputs . To illustrate, we can make an analogy to a physical wallet. An address is like a section of your physical wallet which is separated from other sections. An input is like a bill that is stored in one section of your wallet. In one section of your physical wallet you might have three $20 bills and two $5 bills, for a total of $70 in that section of your wallet. In a similar way, one address of your Blocknet wallet might contain three 20 BLOCK inputs and two 5 BLOCK inputs, for a total of 70 BLOCK in that address of your wallet. When you click the Select coin inputs button in the Coin Control section of the screen above, a screen like the following will appear: On the above screen you can check the boxes next to the inputs from which your BLOCK should be sent. There are two display modes on this screen: List mode - Displays all funded inputs in a wallet in a list format, not collapsing all inputs of an address into an \"address group.\" Tree mode - Displays all funded inputs in a wallet in a hierarchical tree format, collapsing all inputs of an address into an (expandable) \"address group.\" When all inputs have been selected by checking the associated boxes, select Confirm on the Input Selection screen, then select Continue on the next screen to display the following screen: On the above screen, you have the option to enter a specific total fee (not recommended), and an option to subtract fee from total . If you are sending all the funds in your wallet, or all the funds available in the sum of the inputs you selected via Coin Control , then you'll want to check the box to Subtract fee from total . Otherwise, probably not. Next, select Continue and complete the final confirmations on the next screens. Sending Error - What to do \u00b6 If you get an error message saying 'The specified transaction information is bad, please review,' or 'Not enough coin inputs selected to cover this transaction,' click here for what to do... These errors can occur when the wallet tries to create a send transaction using over 666 inputs . (I'm sure the max number of inputs being 666 is just coincidence!) Options for overcoming this limitation include: Select inputs manually with Send Coin Control and ensure you select less than 666 inputs in total. You may want to consolidate a lot of small inputs into a single send transaction. For example, you may want to consume all the 0.015 BLOCK inputs earned from XBridge taker fees in a single send transaction. The best way to do it is to use the Wallet Coin Control feature to lock all the large inputs, then send an amount of BLOCK which is small enough that it will require <= 666 of the small inputs. If the small inputs you want to consolidate are all 0.015 BLOCK in size, that means you need to send less than 10 BLOCK at a time. You will need to repeat this process if your wallet has more than 666 inputs of size 0.015 BLOCK.

If it is blue, staking is active. You can also hover over the icon to read the staking status. Note: Staking will not activate if the wallet is not synced. Since staking is the act of confirming the latest transactions, staking cannot be active until the wallet is synced to the more recent transaction on the network. Note: Newly deposited BLOCK can't stake for 60 minutes. Funds cannot stake until they have had 60 confirmation on the network. This a security precaution and will take roughly 60 minutes (1 confirmation a minute) to be eligible for staking. When staking, you may see your wallet balance show as Immature . This is a normal part of staking. The funds in your wallet that \"won\" the staking reward will remain immature until they have 101 confirmations (101 minutes). When funds are immature, they are unspendable and do not count towards your probability for receiving another reward.

Staking from CLI on a VPS running Ubuntu Linux \u00b6 Warning: If you stake on a Virtual Private Server (VPS), there is some risk your BLOCK could be stolen if your VPS provider turns out to be malicious, or if they carelessly place a malicious actor in a privileged position. The chances of this may be slim for a well-established, reputable VPS provider, yet they do exist because your wallet's private keys are exposed while staking. The risk of this needs to be weighed by each individual against the convenience of staking 24/7 on a remote VPS. Note, some VPS providers do offer services which enable you to easily create and control the keys used for cryptographic operations. Here is an example of such a service. Staking from CLI on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) running Ubuntu Linux Set up an Ubuntu Linux server If you plan to host a Service Node on the same VPS you'll be using for staking, refer to the Service Node Hardware Requirements to determine the HW requirements of the VPS you choose. Otherwise, the following HW requirements will be sufficient for staking only : 1 or more vCPUs 20GB or more storage space 2GB or more of RAM. (1GB of RAM is sufficient if you create 1+GB of swap space in step 11 below). Note: The instructions below assume bash shell, the default shell for Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS Linux, is used. Please adjust as necessary if a different shell is used. If you're new to the Linux Command Line Interface (CLI), learn the basics . You don't have to learn every detail, but learn to navigate the file system, move and remove files and directories, and edit text files with vi , vim or nano . Sign up for an account at an economical, reliable VPS provider. For example, you may wish to explore services available from VPS providers like Contabo , Digital Ocean , Vultr , Amazon AWS and Google Cloud Computing . A Google search for \"VPS hosting provider\" will yield a multitude of other options. You'll want to rent and deploy a VPS running Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS Linux through your VPS provider. Follow the guides available from your VPS provider to launch your Ubuntu VPS and connect to it via ssh (from Mac or Linux Terminal) or via PuTTY (from Windows). For example, here is a nice Quick Start Guide from Digital Ocean , and here is a guide from Contabo on connecting to your VPS . The first time you connect to your VPS, you'll be logged in as root user. Create a new user with the following command, replacing <username> with a username of your choice. adduser <username> You will be prompted for a password. Enter a password for <username> , different from your root password, and store it in a safe place. You will also see prompts for user information, but these can be left blank. Once the new user has been created, add it to the sudo group so it can perform commands as root. Only commands/applications run with sudo will run with root privileges. Others run with regular privileges, so type the following command with your <username> usermod -aG sudo <username> Type exit at the command prompt to end your Linux session and disconnect from your VPS. Reconnect to your VPS (via ssh or PuTTY ), but this time connect as the <username> you just added. Using ssh from Mac or Linux Terminal: ssh <username>@VPS_IP Example: ssh bob@104.22.10.214 Using PuTTY from Windows, configure PuTTY to use VPS_IP as before, but this time login to your VPS with the <username> and password you just set. Update list of available packages. (Enter password for <username> when prompted for the [sudo] password.) sudo apt update Upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages. sudo apt upgrade Make sure nano and unzip packages are installed. sudo apt install nano unzip Create at least as much swap space as you have RAM. So, if you have 16 GB or RAM, you should create at least 16 GB of swap space. Many recommend creating twice as much swap space as you have RAM, which is a good idea if you can spare the disk space. However, more than 16 GB of swap space may not be required. To create swap space: Check if your system already has swap space allocated: swapon --show If the results of swapon --show look similar to this: swapon --show NAME TYPE SIZE USED PRIO /swapfile file 2G 0B -2 that means you already have some swap space allocated and you should follow this guide to allocate 1x-2x more swap space than you have GB of RAM. If the results of swapon --show do not indicate that your system has a swapfile of type file , you'll need to create a new swap file with 1x-2x more swap space than you have GB of RAM. To do so, follow this guide (Highly Recommended) Increase the security of your VPS by setting up SSH Keys to restrict access to your VPS from any computer other than your own . Those connecting via PuTTY from Windows should first follow this guide to set up SSH Keys with PuTTY . Note: If you follow this recommendation to restrict access to your VPS via SSH Keys, back up your SSH Private key and save the password you choose to unlock your SSH Private Key. Set up staking Visit https://github.com/blocknetdx/blocknet/releases/ to see the latest release version of the Blocknet core wallet: As shown in the image above, the latest release version at this time is 4.3.3 . If there is a \"v\" before the release version number, ignore it; do not prepend \"v\" to the BLOCKNET_VERSION you specify in the next step. Create some aliases for easy access to the Blocknet wallet daemon and Blocknet wallet CLI. Use a text editor like vi or nano to edit your ~/.bashrc file. Examples: vi ~/.bashrc nano ~/.bashrc Look for the following 3 lines within ~/.bashrc : if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then . ~/.bash_aliases fi If those 3 lines are not already in your ~/.bashrc file, add them, then save the file and exit the editor. Edit ~/.bash_aliases . (Create a new one if it doesn't exist.) Copy/Paste the following variable and alias definitions into ~/.bash_aliases , replacing 4.3.3 with the latest version of the Blocknet core wallet. (If upgrading from an old version, simply set BLOCKNET_VERSION to the latest version and don't bother changing the alias statements if they are already there from a previous installation.): export BLOCKNET_VERSION='4.3.3' # blocknet-daemon = Start Blocknet daemon for staking wallet alias blocknet-daemon='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknetd -daemon' # blocknet-cli = Staking wallet Command Line Interface alias blocknet-cli='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknet-cli' # blocknet-unlock = Unlock staking wallet for staking only alias blocknet-unlock='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknet-cli walletpassphrase \"$(read -sp \"Enter Password:\" undo; echo $undo;undo=)\" 9999999999 true' # blocknet-unlockfull = Unlock staking wallet fully alias blocknet-unlockfull='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknet-cli walletpassphrase \"$(read -sp \"Enter Password:\" undo; echo $undo;undo=)\" 9999999999 false' Save your edits to ~/.bash_aliases , exit the editor and type the following to activate all the aliases you just defined: source ~/.bash_aliases To confirm all your new aliases have been set, type alias . It should show you a list of all your current aliases, including all you just added. Copy/Paste the following sequence of commands to download and unpack the latest version of the Blocknet core wallet: Change Directory to home directory. cd ~ Download the latest Blocknet wallet: wget https://github.com/blocknetdx/blocknet/releases/download/v${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz Unpack the download: tar xzvf blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz (Recommended) Remove the download package: rm blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz Start the Blocknet daemon using the blocknet-daemon alias you defined above. The first time the Blocknet daemon is started, it creates the Blocknet data directory, ~/.blocknet : blocknet-daemon Without waiting for the wallet to sync , stop the Blocknet daemon using the blocknet-cli alias you defined above: blocknet-cli stop To save 3.5+ hours of time in syncing , it's recommended to use the bootstrap method to speed up syncing: Remove existing blocks , chainstate & indexes directories from the blocknet data directory: rm -rf ~/.blocknet/{blocks,chainstate,indexes} Get the latest bootstrap file: wget https://blocknet.co/files/Blocknet.zip Unzip the bootstrap file: unzip Blocknet.zip Move the required directories to the blocknet data directory: mv Blocknet/{blocks,chainstate,indexes} ~/.blocknet/ Clean up. Remove useless directories & files: rmdir Blocknet/ rm Blocknet.zip Restart the Blocknet daemon: blocknet-daemon Issue the command blocknet-cli getblockcount every 5 minutes or so until the command stops returning error messages and returns a block height which matches that of Chainz Blockchain Explorer . (Check the block height much less frequently if you did not speed up syncing with the bootstrap method of step 6.) At this point, the latest Blocknet wallet is installed and fully synced. Now you can interact with the Blocknet daemon through the Command Line Interface (CLI) as follows: The following are examples of commands you can issue to the Blocknet daemon through the CLI: blocknet-cli getblockchaininfo blocknet-cli getstakingstatus blocknet-cli getblockcount blocknet-cli getblockhash <height> Note: Some of the Blocknet CLI commands take parameters. In the last example above, <height> represents a number to be passed to the getblockhash command as a parameter. To see a full list of all the Blocknet CLI commands, type: blocknet-cli help To learn the details about what a command does and how to use it, type: blocknet-cli help <command> ...where <command> is the command you want to learn about. For example, the following will give full details on the function and use of the getnewaddress command: blocknet-cli help getnewaddress You can also find the same details about all available Blocknet commands at the Blocknet API Portal . Fund your staking wallet. Skip to step 11 if you don't have an already funded Blocknet wallet, or if you prefer to fund your VPS staking wallet by sending funds to it instead of importing an already funded wallet. Otherwise, import an already funded Blocknet wallet from your home computer to your VPS as follows.: Stop the Blocknet daemon on your VPS with the following command: blocknet-cli stop Make space for the funded wallet.dat to be imported to your VPS by renaming the empty wallet.dat to wallet.dat.empty : mv ~/.blocknet/wallets/wallet.dat{,.empty} Assuming you backed up your Blocknet wallet on your home computer, you'll know where to find your funded wallet.dat file. Reference the Backup & Restore Guide to locate your funded wallet.dat . On your home computer, use scp (Mac or Linux) or pscp (Windows) to copy your funded wallet.dat file to your VPS: Mac Terminal (assuming the funded wallet.dat is in the standard place): cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Blocknet/wallets scp wallet.dat <username>@VPS_IP:.blocknet/wallets ...where <username> is the name of the user you created on your VPS and VPS_IP is the IP address of your VPS. Linux Terminal (assuming the funded wallet.dat is in the standard place): cd ~/.blocknet/wallets scp wallet.dat <username>@VPS_IP:.blocknet/wallets ...where <username> is the name of the user you created on your VPS and VPS_IP is the IP address of your VPS. Windows Command Prompt Terminal (assuming the funded wallet.dat is in the standard place). Install pscp . Copy your funded wallet.dat to your VPS as follows: cd %appdata%\\Blocknet\\wallets pscp wallet.dat <username>@VPS_IP:.blocknet/wallets ...where <username> is the name of the user you created on your VPS and VPS_IP is the IP address of your VPS. Restart the Blocknet daemon on your VPS with the following command: blocknet-daemon Note: It is not necessary to delete, remove, uninstall or stop using the Blocknet wallet on your home computer just because you imported your home computer's wallet.dat to your staking VPS. Read more... You can access the same Blocknet wallet on your home computer that is staking on your VPS. For example, if you've imported the wallet.dat from your home computer to your VPS, you can still access the same wallet.dat on your home computer to send & receive funds, or to trade BLOCK on BlockDX . The only thing you have to be careful not to do is to import private key(s) into one wallet.dat and not the other. If you absolutely must import private keys to the wallet on your home computer, for example, then you should either import the same private keys to the wallet on your VPS, or stop the wallet on your VPS and re-import the wallet.dat from your home computer so your VPS wallet will also have the imported private keys. Note, if you've imported private keys, it's recommended to use Coin Control to send the imported keys/addresses to an address in your wallet which is part of the HD wallet hierarchy of addresses associated with your wallet (i.e. send them to an address generated from within your wallet). If you do this, you don't have to import the same private key(s) to both your home computer and your VPS wallets, and you don't have to re-import the wallet.dat from your home computer to your VPS. If you don't have an already funded Blocknet wallet, or you prefer to fund your VPS staking wallet by sending funds to it instead of importing an already funded wallet: Encrypt your VPS wallet using the encryptwallet command. Get details on how to use the encryptwallet command by typing: blocknet-cli help encryptwallet Back up your VPS Blocknet wallet . Hint: Use scp (Mac or Linux) or pscp (Windows) to copy your wallet.dat and/or the dumpfile of your wallet's Private Keys from your VPS to another computer. Use the getnewaddress command to get an address in your VPS Blocknet wallet to which you can send BLOCK. Get details on how to use the getnewaddress command by typing: blocknet-cli help getnewaddress Fund your VPS Blocknet wallet by sending BLOCK to the address you got from issuing the getnewaddress command. At this point, you should have a fully funded staking wallet running on your VPS. The last step is to unlock your VPS wallet for staking . To unlock your wallet for staking only, issue the command: blocknet-unlock When prompted, enter your wallet passphrase to unlock your wallet for staking only. (Your wallet passphrase is the passphrase you specified when you encrypted the wallet.) To see what the blocknet-unlock alias does, type alias blocknet-unlock . It should show you this command: alias blocknet-unlock='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknet-cli walletpassphrase \"$(read -sp \"Enter Password:\" undo; echo $undo;undo=)\" 9999999999 true' The parameters of this command are as follows: \"$(read -sp \"Enter Wallet Passphrase:\" undo; echo $undo;undo=)\" This parameter uses a special bash shell trick which prompts the user for a passphrase and inserts that passphrase as a parameter without recording it in the .bash_history file. (Recording your passphrase in the .bash_history file would be a security risk.) 9999999999 This parameter is the number of seconds you want your wallet to remain unlocked for staking. Do not use a larger number than this; it will fail to unlock your wallet if you attempt to use a larger number. true This parameter tells the walletpassphrase command to unlock for staking only ; don't unlock the wallet fully, which would be a security risk. Confirm your wallet is staking by issuing the command: blocknet-cli getstakingstatus When this command returns, \"status\": \"Staking is active\" , then you know your wallet is staking properly. Note, you may also want to confirm your staking wallet balance is correct with: blocknet-cli getbalance Whenever a new version of the Blocknet wallet is released, upgrade your staking wallet to the latest version by following these steps: Stop the Blocknet daemon: blocknet-cli stop Follow steps 1 through 4 under Set up staking above to install the latest version of the Blocknet wallet and start the new Blocknet daemon. Unlock your wallet for staking with: blocknet-unlock Confirm your wallet is staking as in step 13 above. (Recommended) Remove the directory tree of the old version. Use caution with this command; it recursively removes all files and directories in the specified directory tree: rm -ri ~/blocknet-x.y.z ...where x.y.z represents the old version number. Experienced Linux users can use: rm -r ~/blocknet-x.y.z ...which does not request confirmation before removing all directories and files in the specified directory tree. Orphaned Stakes \u00b6 While staking, you may occasionally see a red flag next to one of your stake hits, like this: If you hover the mouse over the text of the red/orphaned block, it will display the text, \"Generated but not accepted.\" The occasional appearance of a red/orphaned block is normal and nothing to be concerned about. An orphan happens when another block beats your staking node, which generally happens because the staker who won that block was able to get the winning block out to more nodes before your node. If, however, you notice a large number of red/orphaned blocks happening in a short time period, like 5 or more per day, it could mean your staking wallet is on a fork. . If you determine your staking wallet is on a fork, follow the instructions in the Fork Management Guide to get your wallet back on the correct chain. If your staking wallet is not on a fork, but still producing more red/orphaned blocks than you like, here are some possible causes and ideas to reduce the number of orphaned blocks seen by your staking wallet: Your staking wallet doesn't have listen=1 set in its blocknet.conf file (located in the Data Directory ). If you need to add listen=1 to your blocknet.conf , stop your wallet, make the change, then restart your wallet. Your staking wallet doesn't have its P2P port (41412 by default) open to the external world and forwarding to your blocknet wallet. You can check if your wallet's P2P port is open to the external world using this tool . Maximizing Staking Rewards: \u00b6 Peer Connections \u00b6 Some stakers believe they receive more staking rewards when they have more peers connected to their wallet. If you want to test this theory, you can manually add peers to your wallet by following the instructions found here . Dividing funds into optimally sized UTXOs \u00b6 If we look at the history of which sizes of UTXOs / Inputs have been receiving the most staking rewards, we might be inspired to create UTXOs in our staking wallet of those same sizes. To view the sizes of UTXOs which recently got the most rewards (a.k.a. \"stake hits\"): Visit Blocknet Extraction . Scroll to the bottom and you'll see the \"Stake Input Size for the last 1000 blocks\" represented as blue dots on the chart: If you like, you can click show more to see more blue dots: As you can see, the UTXOs receiving the most stake hits are the ones with somewhere between 500 and 5,000 BLOCK (the range where the blue dots are most concentrated). So, making UTXO sized in that range may help to maximize stake hits. One way to organize UTXO sizes is to use Coin Control when sending BLOCK to yourself. This allows you to select from which UTXOs your BLOCK is sent. Note, you'll probably want to check the Subtract fee from total box when sending from a specific set of UTXOs so you don't get an \"Insufficient Funds\" error: An even more convenient way to split your wallet balance into UTXOs of the desired size is the following: Send your entire wallet balance to one address in your wallet. When doing this, be sure to check the Subtract fee from total box, as shown above, so you don't get an \"Insufficient Funds\" error. Issue the splitbalance command from Tools->Debug Console (or from CLI): splitbalance amount address where amount is the size of the UTXOs into which you want to split your balance, and address is the address to which you sent all your block in step 1 above. For example, if a wallet has 5000 block at address XYZ, then splitbalance 1000 XYZ will result in address XYZ containing 5 UTXOs of 1000 block each. (In most cases, the amount being split will not be exactly divisible by amount you specify in the splitbalance command. The remainder will be sent to a change address ). Troubleshooting If you encounter issues, please join Blocknet's Discord and ask a question in the #support channel. Warning: Beware of scams Be cautious of users sending you private messages on Discord to help with troubleshooting, even if they claim to be team members. Scammers will often prey on those having issues and offer help in an attempt to steal funds . This is usually done by impersonating team members . Staking Rewards \u00b6 Probability \u00b6 The selection of the staker that confirms each block is probability-based. This means that everyone\u2019s chance of being selected to confirm the next block is equal to the amount of BLOCK staking divided by the total amount of BLOCK being staked on the network. The amount of staked BLOCK on the network can be seen here . The value will have to be calculated by totaling each amount . Example: Calculating staking reward probability. Assume: You're staking 5000 BLOCK There's a total of 3,325,000 BLOCK staking on the network The probability you will earn the next reward is: 5000 / 3325000 = 0.0015 * 100 = 0.15% This means that, on average, you will earn a reward every: 1 / 0.0015 = 665 minutes = 11.08 hours And the average amount of BLOCK rewarded per day is: 1440 minutes a day / 665 minutes per reward * 1 BLOCK per reward = 2.16 BLOCK With BLOCK valued at $50, that would equate to $108 per day and $39,420 per year. ROI \u00b6 Building off the probabilistic ratio above, the following equation can be derived to estimate the yearly return (in BLOCK) on the initial amount started with. This does not account for compounding, which would increase this value. The amount of staked BLOCK on the network can be seen here . The value will have to be calculated by totaling each amount . Staking ROI = ( [525600] / [total BLOCK staked on the network] ) * 100 525600 = 1 BLOCK reward per minute * 1440 minutes per day * 365 days per year Example: Calculating staking reward ROI. Assume: There's a total of 3,325,000 BLOCK staking on the network The amount you're staking is irrelevant because ROI is a per unit value The yearly ROI under these conditions will be: 525600 / 3325000 = 0.158 * 100 = 15.8% This means that in a year, if you staked 1000 BLOCK the rewards would be: 1000 * 0.158 = 158 BLOCK With BLOCK valued at $50, that would equate to $7,900 per year. // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

Since staking is the act of confirming the latest transactions, staking cannot be active until the wallet is synced to the more recent transaction on the network. Note: Newly deposited BLOCK can't stake for 60 minutes. Funds cannot stake until they have had 60 confirmation on the network. This a security precaution and will take roughly 60 minutes (1 confirmation a minute) to be eligible for staking. When staking, you may see your wallet balance show as Immature . This is a normal part of staking. The funds in your wallet that \"won\" the staking reward will remain immature until they have 101 confirmations (101 minutes). When funds are immature, they are unspendable and do not count towards your probability for receiving another reward. After 101 confirmations, these funds can be spent again and the balance will show up as normal. Stake using the classic wallet Install and setup the Blocknet wallet. Open and sync the wallet .

The chances of this may be slim for a well-established, reputable VPS provider, yet they do exist because your wallet's private keys are exposed while staking. The risk of this needs to be weighed by each individual against the convenience of staking 24/7 on a remote VPS. Note, some VPS providers do offer services which enable you to easily create and control the keys used for cryptographic operations. Here is an example of such a service. Staking from CLI on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) running Ubuntu Linux Set up an Ubuntu Linux server If you plan to host a Service Node on the same VPS you'll be using for staking, refer to the Service Node Hardware Requirements to determine the HW requirements of the VPS you choose. Otherwise, the following HW requirements will be sufficient for staking only : 1 or more vCPUs 20GB or more storage space 2GB or more of RAM. (1GB of RAM is sufficient if you create 1+GB of swap space in step 11 below). Note: The instructions below assume bash shell, the default shell for Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS Linux, is used. Please adjust as necessary if a different shell is used. If you're new to the Linux Command Line Interface (CLI), learn the basics . You don't have to learn every detail, but learn to navigate the file system, move and remove files and directories, and edit text files with vi , vim or nano . Sign up for an account at an economical, reliable VPS provider. For example, you may wish to explore services available from VPS providers like Contabo , Digital Ocean , Vultr , Amazon AWS and Google Cloud Computing . A Google search for \"VPS hosting provider\" will yield a multitude of other options. You'll want to rent and deploy a VPS running Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS Linux through your VPS provider. Follow the guides available from your VPS provider to launch your Ubuntu VPS and connect to it via ssh (from Mac or Linux Terminal) or via PuTTY (from Windows). For example, here is a nice Quick Start Guide from Digital Ocean , and here is a guide from Contabo on connecting to your VPS . The first time you connect to your VPS, you'll be logged in as root user. Create a new user with the following command, replacing <username> with a username of your choice. adduser <username> You will be prompted for a password. Enter a password for <username> , different from your root password, and store it in a safe place. You will also see prompts for user information, but these can be left blank. Once the new user has been created, add it to the sudo group so it can perform commands as root. Only commands/applications run with sudo will run with root privileges. Others run with regular privileges, so type the following command with your <username> usermod -aG sudo <username> Type exit at the command prompt to end your Linux session and disconnect from your VPS. Reconnect to your VPS (via ssh or PuTTY ), but this time connect as the <username> you just added. Using ssh from Mac or Linux Terminal: ssh <username>@VPS_IP Example: ssh bob@104.22.10.214 Using PuTTY from Windows, configure PuTTY to use VPS_IP as before, but this time login to your VPS with the <username> and password you just set. Update list of available packages. (Enter password for <username> when prompted for the [sudo] password.) sudo apt update Upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages. sudo apt upgrade Make sure nano and unzip packages are installed. sudo apt install nano unzip Create at least as much swap space as you have RAM. So, if you have 16 GB or RAM, you should create at least 16 GB of swap space. Many recommend creating twice as much swap space as you have RAM, which is a good idea if you can spare the disk space. However, more than 16 GB of swap space may not be required. To create swap space: Check if your system already has swap space allocated: swapon --show If the results of swapon --show look similar to this: swapon --show NAME TYPE SIZE USED PRIO /swapfile file 2G 0B -2 that means you already have some swap space allocated and you should follow this guide to allocate 1x-2x more swap space than you have GB of RAM. If the results of swapon --show do not indicate that your system has a swapfile of type file , you'll need to create a new swap file with 1x-2x more swap space than you have GB of RAM. To do so, follow this guide (Highly Recommended) Increase the security of your VPS by setting up SSH Keys to restrict access to your VPS from any computer other than your own . Those connecting via PuTTY from Windows should first follow this guide to set up SSH Keys with PuTTY . Note: If you follow this recommendation to restrict access to your VPS via SSH Keys, back up your SSH Private key and save the password you choose to unlock your SSH Private Key. Set up staking Visit https://github.com/blocknetdx/blocknet/releases/ to see the latest release version of the Blocknet core wallet: As shown in the image above, the latest release version at this time is 4.3.3 . If there is a \"v\" before the release version number, ignore it; do not prepend \"v\" to the BLOCKNET_VERSION you specify in the next step. Create some aliases for easy access to the Blocknet wallet daemon and Blocknet wallet CLI. Use a text editor like vi or nano to edit your ~/.bashrc file. Examples: vi ~/.bashrc nano ~/.bashrc Look for the following 3 lines within ~/.bashrc : if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then . ~/.bash_aliases fi If those 3 lines are not already in your ~/.bashrc file, add them, then save the file and exit the editor. Edit ~/.bash_aliases . (Create a new one if it doesn't exist.) Copy/Paste the following variable and alias definitions into ~/.bash_aliases , replacing 4.3.3 with the latest version of the Blocknet core wallet. (If upgrading from an old version, simply set BLOCKNET_VERSION to the latest version and don't bother changing the alias statements if they are already there from a previous installation.): export BLOCKNET_VERSION='4.3.3' # blocknet-daemon = Start Blocknet daemon for staking wallet alias blocknet-daemon='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknetd -daemon' # blocknet-cli = Staking wallet Command Line Interface alias blocknet-cli='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknet-cli' # blocknet-unlock = Unlock staking wallet for staking only alias blocknet-unlock='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknet-cli walletpassphrase \"$(read -sp \"Enter Password:\" undo; echo $undo;undo=)\" 9999999999 true' # blocknet-unlockfull = Unlock staking wallet fully alias blocknet-unlockfull='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknet-cli walletpassphrase \"$(read -sp \"Enter Password:\" undo; echo $undo;undo=)\" 9999999999 false' Save your edits to ~/.bash_aliases , exit the editor and type the following to activate all the aliases you just defined: source ~/.bash_aliases To confirm all your new aliases have been set, type alias . It should show you a list of all your current aliases, including all you just added. Copy/Paste the following sequence of commands to download and unpack the latest version of the Blocknet core wallet: Change Directory to home directory. cd ~ Download the latest Blocknet wallet: wget https://github.com/blocknetdx/blocknet/releases/download/v${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz Unpack the download: tar xzvf blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz (Recommended) Remove the download package: rm blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz Start the Blocknet daemon using the blocknet-daemon alias you defined above. The first time the Blocknet daemon is started, it creates the Blocknet data directory, ~/.blocknet : blocknet-daemon Without waiting for the wallet to sync , stop the Blocknet daemon using the blocknet-cli alias you defined above: blocknet-cli stop To save 3.5+ hours of time in syncing , it's recommended to use the bootstrap method to speed up syncing: Remove existing blocks , chainstate & indexes directories from the blocknet data directory: rm -rf ~/.blocknet/{blocks,chainstate,indexes} Get the latest bootstrap file: wget https://blocknet.co/files/Blocknet.zip Unzip the bootstrap file: unzip Blocknet.zip Move the required directories to the blocknet data directory: mv Blocknet/{blocks,chainstate,indexes} ~/.blocknet/ Clean up. Remove useless directories & files: rmdir Blocknet/ rm Blocknet.zip Restart the Blocknet daemon: blocknet-daemon Issue the command blocknet-cli getblockcount every 5 minutes or so until the command stops returning error messages and returns a block height which matches that of Chainz Blockchain Explorer . (Check the block height much less frequently if you did not speed up syncing with the bootstrap method of step 6.) At this point, the latest Blocknet wallet is installed and fully synced. Now you can interact with the Blocknet daemon through the Command Line Interface (CLI) as follows: The following are examples of commands you can issue to the Blocknet daemon through the CLI: blocknet-cli getblockchaininfo blocknet-cli getstakingstatus blocknet-cli getblockcount blocknet-cli getblockhash <height> Note: Some of the Blocknet CLI commands take parameters. In the last example above, <height> represents a number to be passed to the getblockhash command as a parameter. To see a full list of all the Blocknet CLI commands, type: blocknet-cli help To learn the details about what a command does and how to use it, type: blocknet-cli help <command> ...where <command> is the command you want to learn about. For example, the following will give full details on the function and use of the getnewaddress command: blocknet-cli help getnewaddress You can also find the same details about all available Blocknet commands at the Blocknet API Portal . Fund your staking wallet. Skip to step 11 if you don't have an already funded Blocknet wallet, or if you prefer to fund your VPS staking wallet by sending funds to it instead of importing an already funded wallet. Otherwise, import an already funded Blocknet wallet from your home computer to your VPS as follows.: Stop the Blocknet daemon on your VPS with the following command: blocknet-cli stop Make space for the funded wallet.dat to be imported to your VPS by renaming the empty wallet.dat to wallet.dat.empty : mv ~/.blocknet/wallets/wallet.dat{,.empty} Assuming you backed up your Blocknet wallet on your home computer, you'll know where to find your funded wallet.dat file. Reference the Backup & Restore Guide to locate your funded wallet.dat . On your home computer, use scp (Mac or Linux) or pscp (Windows) to copy your funded wallet.dat file to your VPS: Mac Terminal (assuming the funded wallet.dat is in the standard place): cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Blocknet/wallets scp wallet.dat <username>@VPS_IP:.blocknet/wallets ...where <username> is the name of the user you created on your VPS and VPS_IP is the IP address of your VPS. Linux Terminal (assuming the funded wallet.dat is in the standard place): cd ~/.blocknet/wallets scp wallet.dat <username>@VPS_IP:.blocknet/wallets ...where <username> is the name of the user you created on your VPS and VPS_IP is the IP address of your VPS. Windows Command Prompt Terminal (assuming the funded wallet.dat is in the standard place). Install pscp . Copy your funded wallet.dat to your VPS as follows: cd %appdata%\\Blocknet\\wallets pscp wallet.dat <username>@VPS_IP:.blocknet/wallets ...where <username> is the name of the user you created on your VPS and VPS_IP is the IP address of your VPS. Restart the Blocknet daemon on your VPS with the following command: blocknet-daemon Note: It is not necessary to delete, remove, uninstall or stop using the Blocknet wallet on your home computer just because you imported your home computer's wallet.dat to your staking VPS. Read more... You can access the same Blocknet wallet on your home computer that is staking on your VPS. For example, if you've imported the wallet.dat from your home computer to your VPS, you can still access the same wallet.dat on your home computer to send & receive funds, or to trade BLOCK on BlockDX . The only thing you have to be careful not to do is to import private key(s) into one wallet.dat and not the other. If you absolutely must import private keys to the wallet on your home computer, for example, then you should either import the same private keys to the wallet on your VPS, or stop the wallet on your VPS and re-import the wallet.dat from your home computer so your VPS wallet will also have the imported private keys. Note, if you've imported private keys, it's recommended to use Coin Control to send the imported keys/addresses to an address in your wallet which is part of the HD wallet hierarchy of addresses associated with your wallet (i.e. send them to an address generated from within your wallet). If you do this, you don't have to import the same private key(s) to both your home computer and your VPS wallets, and you don't have to re-import the wallet.dat from your home computer to your VPS. If you don't have an already funded Blocknet wallet, or you prefer to fund your VPS staking wallet by sending funds to it instead of importing an already funded wallet: Encrypt your VPS wallet using the encryptwallet command. Get details on how to use the encryptwallet command by typing: blocknet-cli help encryptwallet Back up your VPS Blocknet wallet . Hint: Use scp (Mac or Linux) or pscp (Windows) to copy your wallet.dat and/or the dumpfile of your wallet's Private Keys from your VPS to another computer. Use the getnewaddress command to get an address in your VPS Blocknet wallet to which you can send BLOCK. Get details on how to use the getnewaddress command by typing: blocknet-cli help getnewaddress Fund your VPS Blocknet wallet by sending BLOCK to the address you got from issuing the getnewaddress command. At this point, you should have a fully funded staking wallet running on your VPS. The last step is to unlock your VPS wallet for staking . To unlock your wallet for staking only, issue the command: blocknet-unlock When prompted, enter your wallet passphrase to unlock your wallet for staking only. (Your wallet passphrase is the passphrase you specified when you encrypted the wallet.) To see what the blocknet-unlock alias does, type alias blocknet-unlock . It should show you this command: alias blocknet-unlock='~/blocknet-${BLOCKNET_VERSION}/bin/blocknet-cli walletpassphrase \"$(read -sp \"Enter Password:\" undo; echo $undo;undo=)\" 9999999999 true' The parameters of this command are as follows: \"$(read -sp \"Enter Wallet Passphrase:\" undo; echo $undo;undo=)\" This parameter uses a special bash shell trick which prompts the user for a passphrase and inserts that passphrase as a parameter without recording it in the .bash_history file. (Recording your passphrase in the .bash_history file would be a security risk.) 9999999999 This parameter is the number of seconds you want your wallet to remain unlocked for staking. Do not use a larger number than this; it will fail to unlock your wallet if you attempt to use a larger number. true This parameter tells the walletpassphrase command to unlock for staking only ; don't unlock the wallet fully, which would be a security risk. Confirm your wallet is staking by issuing the command: blocknet-cli getstakingstatus When this command returns, \"status\": \"Staking is active\" , then you know your wallet is staking properly. Note, you may also want to confirm your staking wallet balance is correct with: blocknet-cli getbalance Whenever a new version of the Blocknet wallet is released, upgrade your staking wallet to the latest version by following these steps: Stop the Blocknet daemon: blocknet-cli stop Follow steps 1 through 4 under Set up staking above to install the latest version of the Blocknet wallet and start the new Blocknet daemon. Unlock your wallet for staking with: blocknet-unlock Confirm your wallet is staking as in step 13 above. (Recommended) Remove the directory tree of the old version. Use caution with this command; it recursively removes all files and directories in the specified directory tree: rm -ri ~/blocknet-x.y.z ...where x.y.z represents the old version number. Experienced Linux users can use: rm -r ~/blocknet-x.y.z ...which does not request confirmation before removing all directories and files in the specified directory tree.","title":"Staking from CLI on a VPS running Ubuntu Linux"},{"location":"wallet/staking/#orphaned-stakes","text":"While staking, you may occasionally see a red flag next to one of your stake hits, like this: If you hover the mouse over the text of the red/orphaned block, it will display the text, \"Generated but not accepted.\" The occasional appearance of a red/orphaned block is normal and nothing to be concerned about. An orphan happens when another block beats your staking node, which generally happens because the staker who won that block was able to get the winning block out to more nodes before your node. If, however, you notice a large number of red/orphaned blocks happening in a short time period, like 5 or more per day, it could mean your staking wallet is on a fork. . If you determine your staking wallet is on a fork, follow the instructions in the Fork Management Guide to get your wallet back on the correct chain. If your staking wallet is not on a fork, but still producing more red/orphaned blocks than you like, here are some possible causes and ideas to reduce the number of orphaned blocks seen by your staking wallet: Your staking wallet doesn't have listen=1 set in its blocknet.conf file (located in the Data Directory ). If you need to add listen=1 to your blocknet.conf , stop your wallet, make the change, then restart your wallet.

Scroll to the bottom and you'll see the \"Stake Input Size for the last 1000 blocks\" represented as blue dots on the chart: If you like, you can click show more to see more blue dots: As you can see, the UTXOs receiving the most stake hits are the ones with somewhere between 500 and 5,000 BLOCK (the range where the blue dots are most concentrated). So, making UTXO sized in that range may help to maximize stake hits. One way to organize UTXO sizes is to use Coin Control when sending BLOCK to yourself. This allows you to select from which UTXOs your BLOCK is sent. Note, you'll probably want to check the Subtract fee from total box when sending from a specific set of UTXOs so you don't get an \"Insufficient Funds\" error: An even more convenient way to split your wallet balance into UTXOs of the desired size is the following: Send your entire wallet balance to one address in your wallet. When doing this, be sure to check the Subtract fee from total box, as shown above, so you don't get an \"Insufficient Funds\" error. Issue the splitbalance command from Tools->Debug Console (or from CLI): splitbalance amount address where amount is the size of the UTXOs into which you want to split your balance, and address is the address to which you sent all your block in step 1 above. For example, if a wallet has 5000 block at address XYZ, then splitbalance 1000 XYZ will result in address XYZ containing 5 UTXOs of 1000 block each.

Therefore, if the wallet is not fully synced, it may not reflect recent transactions. This can cause the an incorrect balance to be shown until syncing is finished. Synchronization \u00b6 When the wallet is opened, it begins syncing automatically. If this is the first time syncing the wallet or if you haven't opened the wallet in a few weeks, you can use a bootstrap to sync the wallet faster.

If the Internet connection on your staking computer may have been unstable, it will be good to see if your wallet has mistakenly banned peers it shouldn't have banned. Check this in the GUI/Qt wallet by going to Tools->Debug Console and issuing the following command: listbanned In the CLI wallet, simply type this in the dir where blocknet-cli exists: ./blocknet-cli listbanned If listbanned shows you have lots of banned peers, it will likely be helpful to issue the clearbanned command. In Tools->Debug Console of the GUI/Qt wallet: clearbanned Or in the CLI wallet, simply type this in the dir where blocknet-cli exists: ./blocknet-cli clearbanned If peer banning becomes a recurring problem, you may want to limit the time for which a peer is banned by adding the following line to your blocknet.conf file, located by default in your Blocknet Data Directory : bantime=180 Then restart your Blocknet wallet for the new bantime to take effect. If, after verifying neither firewall nor antivirus nor banned peers is blocking outgoing connections, you still have 0 peers, try adding peers manually: Quit/Close your wallet Navigate to your data directory: Windows C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Blocknet\\ Or paste %appdata%\\Blocknet\\ into the File Explorer path field. MacOS ~/Library/Application Support/Blocknet/ Open Finder and in the Go menu select Go to Folder... and enter the above path.

Bootstrap \u00b6 A bootstrap is a set of files containing blockchain data up to a certain point in time. Using these files helps shorten the amount of time it takes to sync the wallet since you don't need to sync the blockchain from scratch.

Below are step-by-step instructions for how to install the wallet on each operating system (OS). If you already have the XLite wallet installed and are updating, the steps are basically the same. Note: SegWit Format Addresses support is coming soon to XLite. However, as of this writing (Dec 4, 2021), XLite does not support sending funds to SegWit format addresses. Some exchange wallets receive BTC (and perhaps other coins) in SegWit Format Addresses by default. A SegWit format address is sometimes also called a native or bech32 format address. For the moment, you cannot send BTC or other coins from XLite to a wallet using a SegWit format address. You can only send funds to Legacy format addresses. SegWit format address support will be added soon. Install GUI Wallet \u00b6 Windows Download the latest XLite wallet There are 3 options: XLite-x.x.x-win.exe (recommended - works on 64-bit and 32-bit Windows) XLite-x.x.x-win-x64.zip (for 64-bit Windows) XLite-x.x.x-win-ia32.zip (for 32-bit Windows) Note: Antivirus software may be flagged It is normal for antivirus software to flag the wallet as potentially dangerous.

Once you have your private keys, you can import them into the native wallet of the coin you want to access. For example, if you want to access LTC in your XLite, follow this guide to recover the private keys of your LTC in XLite, then import those private keys into LTC native wallet. Alternatively, you can import the private keys from XLite into another noncustodial multi-wallet, like Exodus . Steps to recover private keys from XLite \u00b6 Visit Ian Coleman's Repository Scroll down on that site and click on bip39-standalone.html to download that file: (Recommended) Verify the integrity of the downloaded file in the same style as you verify the download of the Blocknet wallet . (i.e. compare the sha256sum value of the downloaded file to the expected sha256sum value listed on Ian Coleman's Repository ). (Recommended) For maximum security, disconnect the internet from your computer. Double-click the file, bip39-standalone.html from wherever you downloaded it on your computer. This will open the Ian Coleman Tool in your default browser: Paste your XLite 12 word mnemonic in the field labeled, BIP39 Mnemonic . Select the Coin whose private key you want to recover. (\"BTC - Bitcoin\" in the example image above.) Leave all other fields untouched. Scroll down to display the Derivation Path section: Under Derivation Path , click on the BIP32 tab. (By default it's on BIP44 .) In the field labeled, BIP32 Derivation Path , paste the following value: m/0'/0 Scroll down to display the Derived Addresses section: Search for the XLite address(es) of your coin in the Address column. In most cases, you'll find your XLite address(es) in the first 20 rows. If you don't see your address(es), increase the numbers of rows at bottom of the address list to Show 50 more rows : When you find your coin's address(es), the private key(s) of your address(es) will be listed in the same row on the far right, in the Private Key column. Tip: How to find the XLite address(es) of your coin... Continuing with the example of recovering private keys for Bitcoin (BTC), open XLite and select Transactions->Bitcoin->Unspent : There you will see the BTC address(es) in XLite where your BTC funds are stored. You can copy address(es) from here and search for them in the Derived Addresses section of the Ian Coleman Tool (To search in a browser, use Cmd-f in Mac; Ctrl-f in Windows). If for some reason you are unable to open XLite, you can often find the XLite address(es) of your coins by opening the wallet from which you sent the coins to XLite. Then search the Transaction History in that wallet to see the XLite address(es) to which the coins were sent.
