title: Block DX Exchange Listings
description: Block DX is a decentralized exchange with over 100 assets trading. The exchange has free listings with more continuously being added.


# Block DX Listings
[Block DX](/blockdx/introduction) is the fastest, most secure, most reliable, and most decentralized exchange (DEX), built on the [Blocknet Protocol](/project/introduction). The exchange has over 100 [digital assets](/resources/glossary/#digital-asset) trading ([see below](/blockdx/listings/#listed-digital-assets)), with the number continuously growing as more are made compatible. There is complete trading pair freedom, meaning any two assets can be traded, totaling to over 5000 tradable pairs.

## Listing Process
A Block DX listing holds many benefits beyond just being traded on the exchange. Being listed means the asset has been integrated with the [Blocknet Protocol](/project/introduction), which powers Block DX, and allows other services to be built utilizing the asset. This extends the demand, utility, and accessibility of the asset to the rest of the ecosystem.

Getting listed on Block DX is 100% free. If you would like to have a
digital asset listed, the first step is to confirm the asset meets the following
requirements. If it doesn't currently meet all these requirements, please work with
the developers of the project/asset to ensure they
are all met. If you have questions about any of these requirements, please
[join Blocknet Discord Server](https://discord.gg/vGa7GeCu8B) and ask your
questions in the *#block-dx-listing* channel.

#### Requirements
In order for for a blockchain to be compatible it must support JSON RPC, CLTV atomic swaps, and the following calls:

* createrawtransaction
* decoderawtransaction
* getblock
* getblockchaininfo (fallback getnetworkinfo, getinfo)
* getblockhash
* getnewaddress
* getrawmempool
* getrawtransaction
* gettransaction
* gettxout
* listunspent
* sendrawtransaction
* signmessage
* signrawtransaction (or signrawtransactionwithwallet)
* verifymessage

##  Requirements Met
When all of the above requirements are met,
you are ready to proceed to the next step in listing your asset. At this point, you basically have two options:

??? example "Option 1. Do it yourself."

	This option is 100% free. It could be for you if...

	1. You are comfortable working with [Git Fork-and-Branch](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/) workflow.
	1. You are comfortable editing JSON format files
       [like this](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/manifest-latest.json)
       and creating configuration files [like this](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/xbridge-confs/litecoin--v0.18.1.conf).
	1. You can __*thoroughly test*__ your asset in BlockDX, and that requires
       a [Service Node](/service-nodes/introduction) to host your
       asset's native wallet. The easiest way to have a Service Node
       host your asset's wallet is to own your own Service Node and
       host it yourself. However, if it's not feasible for you to run
       your own Service Node, you can probably find someone in the
       Blocknet Community who will host your asset on their Service
       Node at a very reasonable rate. (If you get lucky, or if your
       asset is expected to have high trade volume, you might
       even find someone to host it for free.) To look for someone to
       host your asset on their Service Node,
       [join Blocknet Discord Server](https://discord.gg/vGa7GeCu8B)
       and ask around in the *#block-dx-listing* channel.

	1. If you can meet criteria 1, 2 & 3 above, use [Git Fork-and-Branch](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/) workflow to:
		1. Create an XBridge Config. file for your asset in the directory, [xbridge-confs](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/tree/master/xbridge-confs).
		1. Create a Wallet Config. file for your asset in the directory, [wallet-confs](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/tree/master/wallet-confs).
		1. Add an object for your asset in the file, [manifest-latest.json](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/manifest-latest.json). 
		1. Add an object for your asset in the file,
           [manifest.json](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/manifest.json). (This
           file is actually identical to `manifest-latest.json`; it may be eliminated someday.)

		The
        [README.md in the blockchain-configuration-files directory](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files#blocknets-blockchain-configuration-files)
        contains full details on how to create & edit these files. It
        also contains detailed instructions for
        [Testing a Blockchain for Compatibility](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files#testing-a-blockchain-for-compatibility),
        which you should be sure to follow before submitting a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to have your listing
        merged into the *master* branch of the Github repository.

		???+ tip "Tip: you may save some time by identifying an already listed asset which is closely related to your asset, then copying/pasting/modifying from that asset."

		??? tip "Tip: How to determine config values for *MinTxFee* & *FeePerByte* in XBridge Config. file."
		*MinTxFee* & *FeePerByte* are two values set in an asset's
		XBridge Config. file which are sometimes confusing to
		people. *MinTxFee* can be used to set a minimum transaction
		fee, but most of the time it works best to keep this value set
		to 0 and instead adjust the value of
		*FeePerByte*. *FeePerByte* is how much to charge per byte for
		an exchange. This can be calculated by looking in the wallet
		send function for the recommended fee per byte and then
		multiplying it by about 2.5 since there are 2 transactions that occur in an exchange: one transaction from one party's address to the P2SH address and then a second transaction from the P2SH address to the counterparty's address. This is one of the reasons why test trades are needed.
		
		??? tip "Tip: Summary of procedure for performing test trades for a new coin integration"
		Here are the basics of testing an integration of a coin called, __COINX__:

			1. There must be at least 1 [Service Node](/service-nodes/introduction) supporting both of the coins you want to trade (ie: COINX and whatever) 
		1. You need two instances of:
		```
		synced Blocknet wallet + BlockDX + synced COINX wallet
		```
		1. You will have to manually configure the BlockDX settings
           for COINX in the `xbridge.conf` file of each local [Blocknet Data Directory](/wallet/backup-restore/#data-directory) since BlockDX doesn't yet know about COINX (unless you also want to build BlockDX).
		1. You need a tiny bit of BLOCK in at least one of the BLOCK wallets (whichever will "take" first). Maker orders are free, taker orders pay a 0.015 BLOCK [taker fee](/blockdx/fees/#taker-fee) every time.
		1. When both instances of both wallets are synced you can start the BlockDXs and tell them you want to trade COINX/BLOCK (or BLOCK/COINX).
		1. If you want to trade COINX/something else you either need a local synced something else wallet for both instances or use XLite and one of the coins it supports. Both parties of any trade need to have synced wallets for both of the coins in the trade. 
		1. When it all works you can submit the [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).


??? example "Option 2. Contract a member of the Blocknet Community to do it for you."

	This option is obviously not 100% free, but there are Blocknet Community members who are willing to do the work of listing & testing your asset, and also willing to host your asset on their Service Node at very reasonable rates. To pursue this option:

	1. [join Blocknet Discord Server](https://discord.gg/vGa7GeCu8B)
	1. Navigate to the *#block-dx-listing* channel in Blocknet Discord.
	1. Post a message requesting __listing__ and __hosting__ services, tagging
       __*@walkjivefly#7204*__ in the post.

## Future Listing Process
In the near future, the listing process will become more automated and it
will be easier for people to "Do It Yourself." There will be a form
where listing applicants fill in all the
[XBridge Configuration](/protocol/xbridge/setup) values for their
asset, then all the necessary file creations and updates will happen
automatically. Note, even with this helpful automation, it will still
be necessary to __*thoroughly test*__ each new asset
on BlockDX before it can be listed.
